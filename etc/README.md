# The ETC Collection

This directory comprises texts that are either unreviewed or of historical significance. These documents are generally distinct from the primary Scrollmapper collection, which can be found in the [main sources collection](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases_deuterocanonical/tree/master/sources) utilized by the Scrollmapper software.

Certain texts, due to their familiarity and credibility, have been integrated into the main collection or were already part of it.

## Church History / Fathers Collection:

Sourced from [Church Fathers Nicene and Ante-Nicene](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases_deuterocanonical/tree/2024/churchFathersNiceneAndAnteNicene)
