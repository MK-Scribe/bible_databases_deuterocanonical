# The ETC Collection

This is a collection of texts that are either unreviewed for the main Scrollmapper collection found in the [main sources collection](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases_deuterocanonical/tree/master/sources) used by the Scrollmapper software.

Some of these texts, based on familiarity and credibility, have been moved over to the main collection or already existed there.
