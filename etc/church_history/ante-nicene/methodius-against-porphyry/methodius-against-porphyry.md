# Methodius: Against Porphyry

[1:1] From the Works of Methodius Against Porphyry.

[1:2] I.

[1:3] This, in truth, must be called most excellent and praiseworthy, which God Himself considers excellent, even if it be despised and scoffed at by all.

[1:4] For things are not what men think them to be.

[1:5] II.

[1:6] Then repentance effaces every sin, when there is no delay after the fall of the soul, and the disease is not suffered to go on through a long interval.

[1:7] For then evil will not have power to leave its mark in us, when it is drawn up at the moment of its being set down like a plant newly planted.

[1:8] III.

[1:9] In truth, our evil comes out of our want of resemblance to God, and our ignorance of Him; and, on the other hand, our great good consists in our resemblance to Him.

[1:10] And, therefore, our conversion and faith in the Being who is incorruptible and divine, seems to be truly our proper good, and ignorance and disregard of Him our evil; if, at least, those things which are produced in us and of us, being the evil effects of sin, are to be considered ours.
