# Origen's Commentary on Matthew Book I

[1:1] Origen's Commentary on Matthew: From the First Book of the Commentary on Matthew.

[1:2] Concerning the four Gospels which alone are uncontroverted in the Church of God under heaven, I have learned by tradition that the Gospel according to Matthew, who was at one time a publican and afterwards an Apostle of Jesus Christ, was written first; and that he composed it in the Hebrew tongue and published it for the converts from Judaism.

[1:3] The second written was that according to Mark, who wrote it according to the instruction of Peter, who, in his General Epistle, acknowledged him as a son, saying, "The church that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son".

[1:4] And third, was that according to Luke, the Gospel commended by Paul, which he composed for the converts from the Gentiles.

[1:5] Last of all, that according to John.
