# Phamphilus: An Expostition of the Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles

[1:1] Pamphilus: An Exposition of the Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.

[1:2] Having had ourselves the advantage of the method and model received from our fathers and teachers, we attempt, in a modest way, to give these in this exposition of the chapters, entreating your forgiveness for the rashness of such an endeavour in us who are young in point both of years and of study, and looking to have the indulgence of every one who reads this writing in prayer on our behalf.
