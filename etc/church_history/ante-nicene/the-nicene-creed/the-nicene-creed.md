# The Nicene Creed

[1:1] The Nicene Creed: As set forth at Nicoea, a.

[1:2] d.

[1:3] We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things, visible and invisible:  And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, only begotten, that is, of the substance of the Father;  God of God; Light of light; very God of very God; begotten, not made; being of one substance with the Father,  By whom all things were made, both things in heaven and things in earth:  Who for us men and for our salvation came down, and was incarnate, and was made man:  He suffered, and rose again the third day:  And ascended into heaven:  And shall come again to judge the quick and the dead.

[1:4] And in the Holy Ghost, etc.

[1:5] The Ratification.

[1:6] And those who say There was a time when He was not, or that Before He was begotten He was not, or that He was made out of nothing; or who say that The Son of God is of any other substance, or that He is changeable or unstable,â€”these the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.

[1:7] Addenda,  As Authorized at Constantinople, a.

[1:8] d.

[1:9] (a) Of heaven and earth.

[1:10] (b) Begotten of the Father before all worlds.

[1:11] (c) By the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary.

[1:12] (d) Was crucified also for us, under Pontius Pilate,  (e) And was buried.

[1:13] (f) Sitteth on the right hand of the Father,  (g) Whose kingdom shall have no end.

[1:14] (h) The Lord, the Giver of life,  Who proceedeth from the Father;  Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified;  Who spake by the prophets:  In one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.

[1:15] We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins.

[1:16] We look for the resurrection of the dead,  And the life of the world to come, Amen.

[1:17] This Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed was solemnly ratified by the Council of Ephesus (a.

[1:18] d.

[1:19] ) with the decree that "No one shall be permitted to introduce, write, or compose any other faith, besides that which was defined by the holy Fathers assembled in the city of Nice, with the presence of the Holy Ghost".
