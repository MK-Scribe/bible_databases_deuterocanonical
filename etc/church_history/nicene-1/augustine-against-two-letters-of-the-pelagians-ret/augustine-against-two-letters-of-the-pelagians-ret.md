[1:1] Against Two Letters of the Pelagians: Extract from Augustin's "Retractations,"  Book II.

[1:2] Chapter 61,  On the Following Treatise,  "contra duas epistolas pelagianorum".

[1:3] Then follow four books which I wrote to Boniface, bishop of the Roman Church, in opposition to two letters of the Pelagians, because when they came into his hands he had sent them to me, finding in them a calumnious mention of my name.

[1:4] This work commences on this wise: "I had indeed known you by the praise of your renowned fame".
