# Basil The Great: Letters

[1:1] Letter I.

[1:2] To Eustathius the Philosopher.

[1:3] Much distressed as I was by the flouts of what is called fortune, who always seems to be hindering my meeting you, I was wonderfully cheered and comforted by your letter, for I had already been turning over in my mind whether what so many people say is really true, that there is a certain Necessity or Fate which rules all the events of our lives both great and small, and that we human beings have control over nothing; or, that at all events, all human life is driven by a kind of luck.

[1:4] You will be very ready to forgive me for these reflexions, when you learn by what causes I was led to make them.

[1:5] On hearing of your philosophy, I entertained a feeling of contempt for the teachers of Athens, and left it.

[1:6] The city on the Hellespont I passed by, more unmoved than any Ulysses, passing Sirens' songs.

[1:7] Asia I admired; but I hurried on to the capital of all that is best in it.

[1:8] When I arrived home, and did not find you,—the prize which I had sought so eagerly,—there began many and various unexpected hindrances.

[1:9] First I must miss you because I fell ill; then when you were setting out for the East I could not start with you; then, after endless trouble, I reached Syria, but I missed the philosopher, who had set out for Egypt.

[1:10] Then I must set out for Egypt, a long and weary way, and even there I did not gain my end.

[1:11] But so passionate was my longing that I must either set out for Persia, and proceed with you to the farthest lands of barbarism, (you had got there; what an obstinate devil possessed me!) or settle here at Alexandria.

[1:12] This last I did.

[1:13] I really think that unless, like some tame beast, I had followed a bough held out to me till I was quite worn out, you would have been driven on and on beyond Indian Nyssa, or any more remote region, and wandered about out there.

[1:14] Why say more?  On returning home, I cannot meet you, hindered by lingering ailments.

[1:15] If these do not get better I shall not be able to meet you even in the winter.

[1:16] Is not all this, as you yourself say, due to Fate? Is not this Necessity? Does not my case nearly outdo poets' tales of Tantalus? But, as I said, I feel better after getting your letter, and am now no longer of the same mind.

[1:17] When God gives good things I think we must thank Him, and not be angry with Him while He is controlling their distribution.

[1:18] So if He grant me to join you, I shall think it best and most delightful; if He put me off, I will gently endure the loss.

[1:19] For He always rules our lives better than we could choose for ourselves.

[2:1] Letter II.

[2:2] Basil to Gregory.

[2:3] 1.

[2:4] [I recognised your letter, as one recognises one's friends' children from their obvious likeness to their parents.

[2:5] Your saying that to describe the kind of place I live in, before letting you hear anything about how I live, would not go far towards persuading you to share my life, was just like you; it was worthy of a soul like yours, which makes nothing of all that concerns this life here, in comparison with the blessedness which is promised us hereafter.

[2:6] What I do myself, day and night, in this remote spot, I am ashamed to write.

[2:7] I have abandoned my life in town, as one sure to lead to countless ills; but I have not yet been able to get quit of myself.

[2:8] I am like travellers at sea, who have never gone a voyage before, and are distressed and seasick, who quarrel with the ship because it is so big and makes such a tossing, and, when they get out of it into the pinnace or dingey, are everywhere and always seasick and distressed.

[2:9] Wherever they go their nausea and misery go with them.

[2:10] My state is something like this.

[2:11] I carry my own troubles with me, and so everywhere I am in the midst of similar discomforts.

[2:12] So in the end I have not got much good out of my solitude.

[2:13] What I ought to have done; what would have enabled me to keep close to the footprints of Him who has led the way to salvation—for He says, "If any one will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow me"—is this.

[2:14] ]  2.

[2:15] We must strive after a quiet mind.

[2:16] As well might the eye ascertain an object put before it while it is wandering restless up and down and sideways, without fixing a steady gaze upon it, as a mind, distracted by a thousand worldly cares, be able clearly to apprehend the truth.

[2:17] He who is not yet yoked in the bonds of matrimony is harassed by frenzied cravings, and rebellious impulses, and hopeless attachments; he who has found his mate is encompassed with his own tumult of cares; if he is childless, there is desire for children; has he children? anxiety about their education, attention to his wife, care of his house, oversight of his servants, misfortunes in trade, quarrels with his neighbours, lawsuits, the risks of the merchant, the toil of the farmer.

[2:18] Each day, as it comes, darkens the soul in its own way; and night after night takes up the day's anxieties, and cheats the mind with illusions in accordance.

[2:19] Now one way of escaping all this is separation from the whole world; that is, not bodily separation, but the severance of the soul's sympathy with the body, and to live so without city, home, goods, society, possessions, means of life, business, engagements, human learning, that the heart may readily receive every impress of divine doctrine.

[2:20] Preparation of heart is the unlearning the prejudices of evil converse.

[2:21] It is the smoothing the waxen tablet before attempting to write on it.

[2:22] Now solitude is of the greatest use for this purpose, inasmuch as it stills our passions, and gives room for principle to cut them out of the soul.

[2:23] [For just as animals are more easily controlled when they are stroked, lust and anger, fear and sorrow, the soul's deadly foes, are better brought under the control of reason, after being calmed by inaction, and where there is no continuous stimulation.

[2:24] ] Let there then be such a place as ours, separate from intercourse with men, that the tenour of our exercises be not interrupted from without.

[2:25] Pious exercises nourish the soul with divine thoughts.

[2:26] What state can be more blessed than to imitate on earth the choruses of angels? to begin the day with prayer, and honour our Maker with hymns and songs? As the day brightens, to betake ourselves, with prayer attending on it throughout, to our labours, and to sweeten our work with hymns, as if with salt? Soothing hymns compose the mind to a cheerful and calm state.

[2:27] Quiet, then, as I have said, is the first step in our sanctification; the tongue purified from the gossip of the world; the eyes unexcited by fair colour or comely shape; the ear not relaxing the tone or mind by voluptuous songs, nor by that especial mischief, the talk of light men and jesters.

[2:28] Thus the mind, saved from dissipation from without, and not through the senses thrown upon the world, falls back upon itself, and thereby ascends to the contemplation of God.

[2:29] [When that beauty shines about it, it even forgets its very nature; it is dragged down no more by thought of food nor anxiety concerning dress; it keeps holiday from earthly cares, and devotes all its energies to the acquisition of the good things which are eternal, and asks only how may be made to flourish in it self-control and manly courage, righteousness and wisdom, and all the other virtues, which, distributed under these heads, properly enable the good man to discharge all the duties of life.

[2:30] ]  3.

[2:31] The study of inspired Scripture is the chief way of finding our duty, for in it we find both instruction about conduct and the lives of blessed men, delivered in writing, as some breathing images of godly living, for the imitation of their good works.

[2:32] Hence, in whatever respect each one feels himself deficient, devoting himself to this imitation, he finds, as from some dispensary, the due medicine for his ailment.

[2:33] He who is enamoured of chastity dwells upon the history of Joseph, and from him learns chaste actions, finding him not only possessed of self-command over pleasure, but virtuously-minded in habit.

[2:34] He is taught endurance by Job [who, not only when the circumstances of life began to turn against him, and in one moment he was plunged from wealth into penury, and from being the father of fair children into childlessness, remained the same, keeping the disposition of his soul all through uncrushed, but was not even stirred to anger against the friends who came to comfort him, and trampled on him, and aggravated his troubles.

[2:35] ] Or should he be enquiring how to be at once meek and great-hearted, hearty against sin, meek towards men, he will find David noble in warlike exploits, meek and unruffled as regards revenge on enemies.

[2:36] Such, too, was Moses rising up with great heart upon sinners against God, but with meek soul bearing their evil-speaking against himself.

[2:37] [Thus, generally, as painters, when they are painting from other pictures, constantly look at the model, and do their best to transfer its lineaments to their own work, so too must he who is desirous of rendering himself perfect in all branches of excellency, keep his eyes turned to the lives of the saints as though to living and moving statues, and make their virtue his own by imitation.

[2:38] 4.

[2:39] Prayers, too, after reading, find the soul fresher, and more vigorously stirred by love towards God.

[2:40] And that prayer is good which imprints a clear idea of God in the soul; and the having God established in self by means of memory is God's indwelling.

[2:41] Thus we become God's temple, when the continuity of our recollection is not severed by earthly cares; when the mind is harassed by no sudden sensations; when the worshipper flees from all things and retreats to God, drawing away all the feelings that invite him to self-indulgence, and passes his time in the pursuits that lead to virtue.

[2:42] ]  5.

[2:43] This, too, is a very important point to attend to,—knowledge how to converse; to interrogate without over-earnestness; to answer without desire of display; not to interrupt a profitable speaker, or to desire ambitiously to put in a word of one's own; to be measured in speaking and hearing; not to be ashamed of receiving, or to be grudging in giving information, nor to pass another's knowledge for one's own, as depraved women their supposititious children, but to refer it candidly to the true parent.

[2:44] The middle tone of voice is best, neither so low as to be inaudible, nor to be ill-bred from its high pitch.

[2:45] One should reflect first what one is going to say, and then give it utterance: be courteous when addressed; amiable in social intercourse; not aiming to be pleasant by facetiousness, but cultivating gentleness in kind admonitions.

[2:46] Harshness is ever to be put aside, even in censuring.

[2:47] [The more you shew modesty and humility yourself, the more likely are you to be acceptable to the patient who needs your treatment.

[2:48] There are however many occasions when we shall do well to employ the kind of rebuke used by the prophet who did not in his own person utter the sentence of condemnation on David after his sin, but by suggesting an imaginary character made the sinner judge of his own sin, so that, after passing his own sentence, he could not find fault with the seer who had convicted him.

[2:49] 6.

[2:50] From the humble and submissive spirit comes an eye sorrowful and downcast, appearance neglected, hair rough, dress dirty; so that the appearance which mourners take pains to present may appear our natural condition.

[2:51] The tunic should be fastened to the body by a girdle, the belt not going above the flank, like a woman's, nor left slack, so that the tunic flows loose, like an idler's.

[2:52] The gait ought not to be sluggish, which shews a character without energy, nor on the other hand pushing and pompous, as though our impulses were rash and wild.

[2:53] The one end of dress is that it should be a sufficient covering alike in winter and summer.

[2:54] As to colour, avoid brightness; in material, the soft and delicate.

[2:55] To aim at bright colours in dress is like women's beautifying when they colour cheeks and hair with hues other than their own.

[2:56] The tunic ought to be thick enough not to want other help to keep the wearer warm.

[2:57] The shoes should be cheap but serviceable.

[2:58] In a word, what one has to regard in dress is the necessary.

[2:59] So too as to food; for a man in good health bread will suffice, and water will quench thirst; such dishes of vegetables may be added as conduce to strengthening the body for the discharge of its functions.

[2:60] One ought not to eat with any exhibition of savage gluttony, but in everything that concerns our pleasures to maintain moderation, quiet, and self-control; and, all through, not to let the mind forget to think of God, but to make even the nature of our food, and the constitution of the body that takes it, a ground and means for offering Him the glory, bethinking us how the various kinds of food, suitable to the needs of our bodies, are due to the provision of the great Steward of the Universe.

[2:61] Before meat let grace be said, in recognition alike of the gifts which God gives now, and which He keeps in store for time to come.

[2:62] Say grace after meat in gratitude for gifts given and petition for gifts promised.

[2:63] Let there be one fixed hour for taking food, always the same in regular course, that of all the four and twenty of the day and night barely this one may be spent upon the body.

[2:64] The rest the ascetic ought to spend in mental exercise.

[2:65] Let sleep be light and easily interrupted, as naturally happens after a light diet; it should be purposely broken by thoughts about great themes.

[2:66] To be overcome by heavy torpor, with limbs unstrung, so that a way is readily opened to wild fancies, is to be plunged in daily death.

[2:67] What dawn is to some this midnight is to athletes of piety; then the silence of night gives leisure to their soul; no noxious sounds or sights obtrude upon their hearts; the mind is alone with itself and God, correcting itself by the recollection of its sins, giving itself precepts to help it to shun evil, and imploring aid from God for the perfecting of what it longs for.

[2:68] ].

[3:1] Letter III.

[3:2] To Candidianus.

[3:3] 1.

[3:4] When I took your letter into my hand, I underwent an experience worth telling.

[3:5] I looked at it with the awe due to a document making some state announcement, and as I was breaking the wax, I felt a dread greater than ever guilty Spartan felt at sight of the Laconian scytale.

[3:6] When, however, I had opened the letter, and read it through, I could not help laughing, partly for joy at finding nothing alarming in it; partly because I likened your state of affairs to that of Demosthenes.

[3:7] Demosthenes, you remember, when he was providing for a certain little company of chorus dancers and musicians, requested to be styled no longer Demosthenes, but "choragus".

[3:8] You are always the same, whether playing the "choragus" or not.

[3:9] "Choragus" you are indeed to soldiers myriads more in number than the individuals to whom Demosthenes supplied necessaries; and yet you do not when you write to me stand on your dignity, but keep up the old style.

[3:10] You do not give up the study of literature, but, as Plato has it, in the midst of the storm and tempest of affairs, you stand aloof, as it were, under some strong wall, and keep your mind clear of all disturbance; nay, more, as far as in you lies, you do not even let others be disturbed.

[3:11] Such is your life; great and wonderful to all who have eyes to see; and yet not wonderful to any one who judges by the whole purpose of your life.

[3:12] Now let me tell my own story, extraordinary indeed, but only what might have been expected.

[3:13] 2.

[3:14] One of the hinds who live with us here at Annesi, on the death of my servant, without alleging any breach of contract with him, without approaching me, without making any complaint, without asking me to make him any voluntary payment, without any threat of violence should he fail to get it, all on a sudden, with certain mad fellows like himself, attacked my house, brutally assaulted the women who were in charge of it, broke in the doors, and after appropriating some of the contents himself, and promising the rest to any one who liked, carried off everything.

[3:15] I do not wish to be regarded as the ne plus ultra of helplessness, and a suitable object for the violence of any one who likes to attack me.

[3:16] Shew me, then, now, I beg you, that kindly interest which you have always shewn in my affairs.

[3:17] Only on one condition can my tranquillity be secured,—that I be assured of having your energy on my side.

[3:18] It would be quite punishment enough, from my point of view, if the man were apprehended by the district magistrate and locked up for a short period in the gaol.

[3:19] It is not only that I am indignant at the treatment I have suffered, but I want security for the future.

[4:1] Letter IV.

[4:2] To Olympius.

[4:3] What do you mean, my dear Sir, by evicting from our retreat my dear friend and nurse of philosophy, Poverty? Were she but gifted with speech, I take it you would have to appear as defendant in an action for unlawful ejectment.

[4:4] She might plead "I chose to live with this man Basil, an admirer of Zeno, who, when he had lost everything in a shipwreck, cried, with great fortitude, 'well done, Fortune! you are reducing me to the old cloak;' a great admirer of Cleanthes, who by drawing water from the well got enough to live on and pay his tutors' fees as well; an immense admirer of Diogenes, who prided himself on requiring no more than was absolutely necessary, and flung away his bowl after he had learned from some lad to stoop down and drink from the hollow of his hand".

[4:5] In some such terms as these you might be chidden by my dear mate Poverty, whom your presents have driven from house and home.

[4:6] She might too add a threat; "if I catch you here again, I shall shew that what went before was Sicilian or Italian luxury: so I shall exactly requite you out of my own store".

[4:7] But enough of this.

[4:8] I am very glad that you have already begun a course of medicine, and pray that you may be benefited by it.

[4:9] A condition of body fit for painless activity would well become so pious a soul.

[5:1] Letter V.

[5:2] To Nectarius.

[5:3] 1.

[5:4] I heard of your unendurable loss, and was much distressed.

[5:5] Three or four days went by, and I was still in some doubt because my informant was not able to give me any clear details of the melancholy event.

[5:6] While I was incredulous about what was noised abroad, because I prayed that it might not be true, I received a letter from the Bishop fully confirming the unhappy tidings.

[5:7] I need not tell you how I sighed and wept.

[5:8] Who could be so stony-hearted, so truly inhuman, as to be insensible to what has occurred, or be affected by merely moderate grief? He is gone; heir of a noble house, prop of a family, a father's hope, offspring of pious parents, nursed with innumerable prayers, in the very bloom of manhood, torn from his father's hands.

[5:9] These things are enough to break a heart of adamant and make it feel.

[5:10] It is only natural then that I am deeply touched at this trouble; I who have been intimately connected with you from the beginning and have made your joys and sorrows mine.

[5:11] But yesterday it seemed that you had only little to trouble you, and that your life's stream was flowing prosperously on.

[5:12] In a moment, by a demon's malice, all the happiness of the house, all the brightness of life, is destroyed, and our lives are made a doleful story.

[5:13] If we wish to lament and weep over what has happened, a lifetime will not be enough and if all mankind mourns with us they will be powerless to make their lamentation match our loss.

[5:14] Yes, if all the streams run tears they will not adequately weep our woe.

[5:15] 2.

[5:16] But we mean,—do we not?—to bring out the gift which God has stored in our hearts; I mean that sober reason which in our happy days is wont to draw lines of limitation round our souls, and when troubles come about us to recall to our minds that we are but men, and to suggest to us, what indeed we have seen and heard, that life is full of similar misfortunes, and that the examples of human sufferings are not a few.

[5:17] Above all, this will tell us that it is God's command that we who trust in Christ should not grieve over them who are fallen asleep, because we hope in the resurrection; and that in reward for great patience great crowns of glory are kept in store by the Master of life's course.

[5:18] Only let us allow our wiser thoughts to speak to us in this strain of music, and we may peradventure discover some slight alleviation of our trouble.

[5:19] Play the man, then, I implore you; the blow is a heavy one, but stand firm; do not fall under the weight of your grief; do not lose heart.

[5:20] Be perfectly assured of this, that though the reasons for what is ordained by God are beyond us, yet always what is arranged for us by Him Who is wise and Who loves us is to be accepted, be it ever so grievous to endure.

[5:21] He Himself knows how He is appointing what is best for each and why the terms of life that He fixes for us are unequal.

[5:22] There exists some reason incomprehensible to man why some are sooner carried far away from us, and some are left a longer while behind to bear the burdens of this painful life.

[5:23] So we ought always to adore His loving kindness, and not to repine, remembering those great and famous words of the great athlete Job, when he had seen ten children at one table, in one short moment, crushed to death, "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away".

[5:24] As the Lord thought good so it came to pass.

[5:25] Let us adopt those marvellous words.

[5:26] At the hands of the righteous Judge, they who show like good deeds shall receive a like reward.

[5:27] We have not lost the lad; we have restored him to the Lender.

[5:28] His life is not destroyed; it is changed for the better.

[5:29] He whom we love is not hidden in the ground; he is received into heaven.

[5:30] Let us wait a little while, and we shall be once more with him.

[5:31] The time of our separation is not long, for in this life we are all like travellers on a journey, hastening on to the same shelter.

[5:32] While one has reached his rest another arrives, another hurries on, but one and the same end awaits them all.

[5:33] He has outstripped us on the way, but we shall all travel the same road, and the same hostelry awaits us all.

[5:34] God only grant that we through goodness may be likened to his purity, to the end that for the sake of our guilelessness of life we may attain the rest which is granted to them that are children in Christ.

[6:1] Letter VI.

[6:2] To the wife of Nectarius.

[6:3] 1.

[6:4] I hesitated to address your excellency, from the idea that, just as to the eye when inflamed even the mildest of remedies causes pain, so to a soul distressed by heavy sorrow, words offered in the moment of agony, even though they do bring much comfort, seem to be somewhat out of place.

[6:5] But I bethought me that I should be speaking to a Christian woman, who has long ago learned godly lessons, and is not inexperienced in the vicissitudes of human life, and I judged it right not to neglect the duty laid upon me.

[6:6] I know what a mother's heart is, and when I remember how good and gentle you are to all, I can reckon the probable extent of your misery at this present time.

[6:7] You have lost a son whom, while he was alive, all mothers called happy, with prayers that their own might be like him, and on his death bewailed, as though each had hidden her own in the grave.

[6:8] His death is a blow to two provinces, both to mine and to Cilicia.

[6:9] With him has fallen a great and illustrious race, dashed to the ground as by the withdrawal of a prop.

[6:10] Alas for the mighty mischief that the contact with an evil demon was able to wreak! Earth, what a calamity thou hast been compelled to sustain! If the sun had any feeling one would think he might have shuddered at so sad a sight.

[6:11] Who could utter all that the spirit in its helplessness would have said?  2.

[6:12] But our lives are not without a Providence.

[6:13] So we have learnt in the Gospel, for not a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of our Father.

[6:14] Whatever has come to pass has come to pass by the will of our Creator.

[6:15] And who can resist God's will? Let us accept what has befallen us; for if we take it ill we do not mend the past and we work our own ruin.

[6:16] Do not let us arraign the righteous judgment of God.

[6:17] We are all too untaught to assail His ineffable sentences.

[6:18] The Lord is now making trial of your love for Him.

[6:19] Now there is an opportunity for you, through your patience, to take the martyr's lot.

[6:20] The mother of the Maccabees saw the death of seven sons without a sigh, without even shedding one unworthy tear.

[6:21] She gave thanks to God for seeing them freed from the fetters of the flesh by fire and steel and cruel blows, and she won praise from God, and fame among men.

[6:22] The loss is great, as I can say myself; but great too are the rewards laid up by the Lord for the patient.

[6:23] When first you were made a mother, and saw your boy, and thanked God, you knew all the while that, a mortal yourself, you had given birth to a mortal.

[6:24] What is there astonishing in the death of a mortal? But we are grieved at his dying before his time.

[6:25] Are we sure that this was not his time? We do not know how to pick and choose what is good for our souls, or how to fix the limits of the life of man.

[6:26] Look round at all the world in which you live; remember that everything you see is mortal, and all subject to corruption.

[6:27] Look up to heaven; even it shall be dissolved; look at the sun, not even the sun will last for ever.

[6:28] All the stars together, all living things of land and sea, all that is fair on earth, aye, earth itself, all are subject to decay; yet a little while and all shall be no more.

[6:29] Let these considerations be some comfort to you in your trouble.

[6:30] Do not measure your loss by itself; if you do it will seem intolerable; but if you take all human affairs into account you will find that some comfort is to be derived from them.

[6:31] Above all, one thing I would strongly urge; spare your husband.

[6:32] Be a comfort to others.

[6:33] Do not make his trouble harder to bear by wearing yourself away with sorrow.

[6:34] Mere words I know cannot give comfort.

[6:35] Just now what is wanted is prayer; and I do pray the Lord Himself to touch your heart by His unspeakable power, and through good thoughts to cause light to shine upon your soul, that you may have a source of consolation in yourself.

[7:1] Letter VII.

[7:2] To Gregory my friend.

[7:3] When I wrote to you, I was perfectly well aware that no theological term is adequate to the thought of the speaker, or the want of the questioner, because language is of natural necessity too weak to act in the service of objects of thought.

[7:4] If then our thought is weak, and our tongue weaker than our thought, what was to be expected of me in what I said but that I should be charged with poverty of expression? Still, it was not possible to let your question pass unnoticed.

[7:5] It looks like a betrayal, if we do not readily give an answer about God to them that love the Lord.

[7:6] What has been said, however, whether it seems satisfactory, or requires some further and more careful addition, needs a fit season for correction.

[7:7] For the present I implore you, as I have implored you before, to devote yourself entirely to the advocacy of the truth, and to the intellectual energies God gives you for the establishment of what is good.

[7:8] With this be content, and ask nothing more from me.

[7:9] I am really much less capable than is supposed, and am more likely to do harm to the word by my weakness than to add strength to the truth by my advocacy.

[8:1] Letter VIII.

[8:2] To the Caesareans.

[8:3] A defence of his withdrawal, and concerning the faith.

[8:4] 1.

[8:5] I have often been astonished at your feeling towards me as you do, and how it comes about that an individual so small and insignificant, and having, may be, very little that is lovable about him, should have so won your allegiance.

[8:6] You remind me of the claims of friendship and of fatherland, and press me urgently in your attempt to make me come back to you, as though I were a runaway from a father's heart and home.

[8:7] That I am a runaway I confess.

[8:8] I should be sorry to deny it; since you are already regretting me, you shall be told the cause.

[8:9] I was astounded like a man stunned by some sudden noise.

[8:10] I did not crush my thoughts, but dwelt upon them as I fled, and now I have been absent from you a considerable time.

[8:11] Then I began to yearn for the divine doctrines, and the philosophy that is concerned with them.

[8:12] How, said I, could I overcome the mischief dwelling with us? Who is to be my Laban, setting me free from Esau, and leading me to the supreme philosophy? By God's help, I have, so far as in me lies, attained my object; I have found a chosen vessel, a deep well; I mean Gregory, Christ's mouth.

[8:13] Give me, therefore, I beg you, a little time.

[8:14] I am not embracing a city life.

[8:15] I am quite well aware how the evil one by such means devises deceit for mankind, but I do hold the society of the saints most useful.

[8:16] For in the more constant change of ideas about the divine dogmas I am acquiring a lasting habit of contemplation.

[8:17] Such is my present situation.

[8:18] 2.

[8:19] Friends godly and well beloved, do, I implore you, beware of the shepherds of the Philistines; let them not choke your wills unawares; let them not befoul the purity of your knowledge of the faith.

[8:20] This is ever their object, not to teach simple souls lessons drawn from Holy Scripture, but to mar the harmony of the truth by heathen philosophy.

[8:21] Is not he an open Philistine who is introducing the terms "unbegotten" and "begotten" into our faith, and asserts that there was once a time when the Everlasting was not; that He who is by nature and eternally a Father became a Father; that the Holy Ghost is not eternal? He bewitches our Patriarch's sheep that they may not drink "of the well of water springing up into everlasting life," but may rather bring upon themselves the words of the prophet, "They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water;" when all the while they ought to confess that the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, as they have been taught by the divine words, and by those who have understood them in their highest sense.

[8:22] Against those who cast it in our teeth that we are Tritheists, let it be answered that we confess one God not in number but in nature.

[8:23] For everything which is called one in number is not one absolutely, nor yet simple in nature; but God is universally confessed to be simple and not composite.

[8:24] God therefore is not one in number.

[8:25] What I mean is this.

[8:26] We say that the world is one in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple; for we divide it into its constituent elements, fire, water, air, and earth.

[8:27] Again, man is called one in number.

[8:28] We frequently speak of one man, but man who is composed of body and soul is not simple.

[8:29] Similarly we say one angel in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple, for we conceive of the hypostasis of the angel as essence with sanctification.

[8:30] If therefore everything which is one in number is not one in nature, and that which is one and simple in nature is not one in number; and if we call God one in nature how can number be charged against us, when we utterly exclude it from that blessed and spiritual nature? Number relates to quantity; and quantity is conjoined with bodily nature, for number is of bodily nature.

[8:31] We believe our Lord to be Creator of bodies.

[8:32] Wherefore every number indicates those things which have received a material and circumscribed nature.

[8:33] Monad and Unity on the other hand signify the nature which is simple and incomprehensible.

[8:34] Whoever therefore confesses either the Son of God or the Holy Ghost to be number or creature introduces unawares a material and circumscribed nature.

[8:35] And by circumscribed I mean not only locally limited, but a nature which is comprehended in foreknowledge by Him who is about to educe it from the non-existent into the existent and which can be comprehended by science.

[8:36] Every holy thing then of which the nature is circumscribed and of which the holiness is acquired is not insusceptible of evil.

[8:37] But the Son and the Holy Ghost are the source of sanctification by which every reasonable creature is hallowed in proportion to its virtue.

[8:38] 3.

[8:39] We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like, nor unlike the Father.

[8:40] Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality.

[8:41] We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance.

[8:42] From this the consubstantiality is proved.

[8:43] For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in essence or substance.

[8:44] But when even man is called "god" as in the words, "I have said ye are gods," and "daemon" as in the words, "The gods of the nations are daemons," in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly.

[8:45] God alone is substantially and essentially God.

[8:46] When I say "alone" I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and substance of God.

[8:47] For the word "alone" is used in the case of any individual and generally of human nature.

[8:48] In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and "heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter," and of human nature, as when David says, "as for man his days are as grass," not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal.

[8:49] So we understand these words to be said of the nature, "who alone hath immortality" and "to God only wise," and "none is good save one, that is God," for here "one" means the same as alone.

[8:50] So also, "which alone spreadest out the heavens," and again "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve".

[8:51] "There is no God beside me".

[8:52] In Scripture "one" and "only" are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so called.

[8:53] As for instance, "The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them," and "then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and did serve the Lord only".

[8:54] And so St.

[8:55] Paul, "For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but one god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things".

[8:56] Here we enquire why when he had said "one God" he was not content, for we have said that "one" and "only" when applied to God, indicate nature.

[8:57] Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase "one God," without, by the further addition of "the Father," expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifying the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection.

[8:58] For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us.

[8:59] For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of "Jesus Christ," and charges His disciples to "tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ".

[8:60] For His purpose was, after the completion of the oeconomy, after His resurrection from the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ.

[8:61] Such is the force of the words "That they may know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent," and again "Ye believe in God, believe also in me".

[8:62] Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in one direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy, and so by omission falling into impiety.

[8:63] 4.

[8:64] Now let us examine, and to the best of our ability explain, the meaning of the words of Holy Scripture, which our opponents seize and wrest to their own sense, and urge against us for the destruction of the glory of the Only-begotten.

[8:65] First of all take the words "I live because of the Father," for this is one of the shafts hurled heavenward by those who impiously use it.

[8:66] These words I do not understand to refer to the eternal life; for whatever lives because of something else cannot be self-existent, just as that which is warmed by another cannot be warmth itself; but He Who is our Christ and God says, "I am the life".

[8:67] I understand the life lived because of the Father to be this life in the flesh, and in this time.

[8:68] Of His own will He came to live the life of men.

[8:69] He did not say "I have lived because of the Father," but "I live because of the Father," clearly indicating the present time, and the Christ, having the word of God in Himself, is able to call the life which He leads, life, and that this is His meaning we shall learn from what follows.

[8:70] "He that eateth me," He says, "he also shall live because of me;" for we eat His flesh, and drink His blood, being made through His incarnation and His visible life partakers of His Word and of His Wisdom.

[8:71] For all His mystic sojourn among us He called flesh and blood, and set forth the teaching consisting of practical science, of physics, and of theology, whereby our soul is nourished and is meanwhile trained for the contemplation of actual realities.

[8:72] This is perhaps the intended meaning of what He says.

[8:73] 5.

[8:74] And again, "My Father is greater than I".

[8:75] This passage is also employed by the ungrateful creatures, the brood of the evil one.

[8:76] I believe that even from this passage the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father is set forth.

[8:77] For I know that comparisons may properly be made between things which are of the same nature.

[8:78] We speak of angel as greater than angel, of man as juster than man, of bird as fleeter than bird.

[8:79] If then comparisons are made between things of the same species, and the Father by comparison is said to be greater than the Son, then the Son is of the same substance as the Father.

[8:80] But there is another sense underlying the expression.

[8:81] In what is it extraordinary that He who "is the Word and was made flesh" confesses His Father to be greater than Himself, when He was seen in glory inferior to the angels, and in form to men? For "Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels," and again "Who was made a little lower than the angels," and "we saw Him and He had neither form nor comeliness, his form was deficient beyond all men".

[8:82] All this He endured on account of His abundant loving kindness towards His work, that He might save the lost sheep and bring it home when He had saved it, and bring back safe and sound to his own land the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and so fell among thieves.

[8:83] Will the heretic cast in His teeth the manger out of which he in his unreasonableness was fed by the Word of reason? Will he, because the carpenter's son had no bed to lie on, complain of His being poor? This is why the Son is less than the Father; for your sakes He was made dead to free you from death and make you sharer in heavenly life.

[8:84] It is just as though any one were to find fault with the physician for stooping to sickness, and breathing its foul breath, that he may heal the sick.

[8:85] 6.

[8:86] It is on thy account that He knows not the hour and the day of judgment.

[8:87] Yet nothing is beyond the ken of the real Wisdom, for "all things were made by Him;" and even among men no one is ignorant of what he has made.

[8:88] But this is His dispensation because of thine own infirmity, that sinners be not plunged into despair by the narrow limits of the appointed period, no opportunity for repentance being left them; and that, on the other hand, those who are waging a long war with the forces of the enemy may not desert their post on account of the protracted time.

[8:89] For both of these classes He arranges by means of His assumed ignorance; for the former cutting the time short for their glorious struggle's sake; for the latter providing an opportunity for repentance because of their sins.

[8:90] In the gospels He numbered Himself among the ignorant, on account, as I have said, of the infirmity of the greater part of mankind.

[8:91] In the Acts of the Apostles, speaking, as it were, to the perfect apart, He says, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power".

[8:92] Here He implicitly excepts Himself.

[8:93] So much for a rough statement by way of preliminary attack.

[8:94] Now let us enquire into the meaning of the text from a higher point of view.

[8:95] Let me knock at the door of knowledge, if haply I may wake the Master of the house, Who gives the spiritual bread to them who ask Him, since they whom we are eager to entertain are friends and brothers.

[8:96] 7.

[8:97] Our Saviour's holy disciples, after getting beyond the limits of human thought, and then being purified by the word, are enquiring about the end, and longing to know the ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His angels and to Himself.

[8:98] He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of God, a day; and the contemplation of the One-ness and Unity, knowledge of which He attributes to the Father alone, an hour.

[8:99] I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to know of Himself what is; and not to know what is not; God, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is said to know righteousness and wisdom; but to be ignorant of unrighteousness and wickedness; for God who created us is not unrighteousness and wickedness.

[8:100] If, then, God is said to know about Himself that which is, and not to know that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the purpose of the Incarnation and the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then our Saviour does not know the end and the ultimate blessedness.

[8:101] But He says the angels do not know; that is to say, not even the contemplation which is in them, nor the methods of their ministries are the ultimate object of desire.

[8:102] For even their knowledge, when compared with the knowledge which is face to face, is dense.

[8:103] Only the Father, He says, knows, since He is Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer know God in mirrors and not immediately, but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall know even the ultimate end.

[8:104] For all material knowledge is said to be the kingdom of Christ; while immaterial knowledge, and so to say the knowledge of actual Godhead, is that of God the Father.

[8:105] But our Lord is also Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness according to the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the Gospel? "I will raise him up at the last day".

[8:106] He calls the transition from material knowledge to immaterial contemplation a resurrection, speaking of that knowledge after which there is no other, as the last day: for our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at the time when it contemplates the One-ness and Unity of the Word.

[8:107] But since our intelligence is made dense and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and incapable of gazing intently in pure contemplation, being led through adornments cognate to its own body.

[8:108] It considers the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by their effects, to the end that growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to approach even the actual unveiled Godhead.

[8:109] This is the meaning, I think, of the words "my Father is greater than I," and also of the statement, "It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is prepared by my Father".

[8:110] This too is what is meant by Christ's "delivering up the kingdom to God even the Father;" inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is regarded relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first fruits.

[8:111] It is in accordance with this view that when His disciples asked Him again in the Acts of the Apostles, "When wilt thou restore the kingdom of Israel?" He replied, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power".

[8:112] That is to say, the knowledge of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and blood.

[8:113] This contemplation the Father hath put away in His own power, meaning by "power" those that are empowered, and by "His own" those who are not held down by the ignorance of things below.

[8:114] Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain distinctions of knowledge made by the sun apprehended by mental perception.

[8:115] For our Lord's prayer must be carried out.

[8:116] It is Jesus Who prayed "Grant that they may be one in us as I and Thou are one, Father".

[8:117] For when God, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and number is lost in the in-dwelling of Unity.

[8:118] This is my second attempt to attack the text.

[8:119] If any one has a better interpretation to give, and can consistently with true religion amend what I say, let him speak and let him amend, and the Lord will reward him for me.

[8:120] There is no jealousy in my heart.

[8:121] I have not approached this investigation of these passages for strife and vain glory.

[8:122] I have done so to help my brothers, lest the earthen vessels which hold the treasure of God should seem to be deceived by stony-hearted and uncircumcised men, whose weapons are the wisdom of folly.

[8:123] 8.

[8:124] Again, as is said through Solomon the Wise in the Proverbs, "He was created;" and He is named "Beginning of ways" of good news, which lead us to the kingdom of heaven.

[8:125] He is not in essence and substance a creature, but is made a "way" according to the oeconomy.

[8:126] Being made and being created signify the same thing.

[8:127] As He was made a way, so was He made a door, a shepherd, an angel, a sheep, and again a High Priest and an Apostle, the names being used in other senses.

[8:128] What again would the heretics say about God unsubjected, and about His being made sin for us? For it is written "But when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him".

[8:129] Are you not afraid, sir, of God called unsubjected? For He makes thy subjection His own; and because of thy struggling against goodness He calls himself unsubjected.

[8:130] In this sense too He once spoke of Himself as persecuted—"Saul, Saul," He says, "why persecutest thou me?" on the occasion when Saul was hurrying to Damascus with a desire to imprison the disciples.

[8:131] Again He calls Himself naked, when any one of his brethren is naked.

[8:132] "I was naked," He says, "and ye clothed me;" and so when another is in prison He speaks of Himself as imprisoned, for He Himself took away our sins and bare our sicknesses.

[8:133] Now one of our infirmities is not being subject, and He bare this.

[8:134] So all the things which happen to us to our hurt He makes His own, taking upon Him our sufferings in His fellowship with us.

[8:135] 9.

[8:136] But another passage is also seized by those who are fighting against God to the perversion of their hearers: I mean the words "The Son can do nothing of Himself".

[8:137] To me this saying too seems distinctly declaratory of the Son's being of the same nature as the Father.

[8:138] For if every rational creature is able to do anything of himself, and the inclination which each has to the worse and to the better is in his own power, but the Son can do nothing of Himself, then the Son is not a creature.

[8:139] And if He is not a creature, then He is of one essence and substance with the Father.

[8:140] Again; no creature can do what he likes.

[8:141] But the Son does what He wills in heaven and in earth.

[8:142] Therefore the Son is not a creature.

[8:143] Again; all creatures are either constituted of contraries or receptive of contraries.

[8:144] But the Son is very righteousness, and immaterial.

[8:145] Therefore the Son is not a creature, and if He is not a creature, He is of one essence and substance with the Father.

[8:146] 10.

[8:147] This examination of the passages before us is, so far as my ability goes, sufficient.

[8:148] Now let us turn the discussion on those who attack the Holy Spirit, and cast down every high thing of their intellect that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.

[8:149] You say that the Holy Ghost is a creature.

[8:150] And every creature is a servant of the Creator, for "all are thy servants".

[8:151] If then He is a servant, His holiness is acquired; and everything of which the holiness is acquired is receptive of evil; but the Holy Ghost being holy in essence is called "fount of holiness".

[8:152] Therefore the Holy Ghost is not a creature.

[8:153] If He is not a creature, He is of one essence and substance with the Father.

[8:154] How, tell me, can you give the name of servant to Him Who through your baptism frees you from your servitude? "The law," it is said, "of the Spirit of life hath made me free from the law of sin".

[8:155] But you will never venture to call His nature even variable, so long as you have regard to the nature of the opposing power of the enemy, which, like lightning, is fallen from heaven and fell out of the true life because its holiness was acquired, and its evil counsels were followed by its change.

[8:156] So when it had fallen away from the Unity and had cast from it its angelic dignity, it was named after its character "Devil," its former and blessed condition being extinct and this hostile power being kindled.

[8:157] Furthermore if he calls the Holy Ghost a creature he describes His nature as limited.

[8:158] How then can the two following passages stand? "The Spirit of the Lord filleth the world;" and "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?" But he does not, it would seem, confess Him to be simple in nature; for he describes Him as one in number.

[8:159] And, as I have already said, everything that is one in number is not simple.

[8:160] And if the Holy Spirit is not simple, He consists of essence and sanctification, and is therefore composite.

[8:161] But who is mad enough to describe the Holy Spirit as composite, and not simple, and consubstantial with the Father and the Son?  11.

[8:162] If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit specially from the following point of view.

[8:163] In Scripture we find mention of three creations.

[8:164] The first is the evolution from non-being into being.

[8:165] The second is change from the worse to the better.

[8:166] The third is the resurrection of the dead.

[8:167] In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son.

[8:168] There is a bringing into existence of the heavens; and what says David? "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth".

[8:169] Again, man is created through baptism, for "if any man be in Christ he is a new creature".

[8:170] And why does the Saviour say to the disciples, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost"? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the Father and the Son.

[8:171] And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.

[8:172] And He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.

[8:173] For what the holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal.

[8:174] Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven.

[8:175] What does he say? "You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you".

[8:176] Now every temple is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God.

[8:177] It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder.

[8:178] And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for "He that built all things is God".

[8:179] If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.

[8:180] Supposing them to object to the word "God," let them learn what this word means.

[8:181] God is called Θεὸς either because He placed (τεθεικέναι) all things or because He beholds (Θεᾶσθαι) all things.

[8:182] If He is called Θεὸς because He "placed" or "beholds" all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.

[8:183] Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God, then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word.

[8:184] Is He named the right hand of the Father? For "the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;" and "thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy".

[8:185] But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said "if I by the finger of God cast out devils," of which the version in another Gospel is "if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils".

[8:186] So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son.

[8:187] 12.

[8:188] So much must suffice for the present on the subject of the adorable and holy Trinity.

[8:189] It is not now possible to extend the enquiry about it further.

[8:190] Do ye take seeds from a humble person like me, and cultivate the ripe ear for yourselves, for, as you know, in such cases we look for interest.

[8:191] But I trust in God that you, because of your pure lives, will bring forth fruit thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold.

[8:192] For, it is said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

[8:193] And, my brethren, entertain no other conception of the kingdom of the heavens than that it is the very contemplation of realities.

[8:194] This the divine Scriptures call blessedness.

[8:195] For "the kingdom of heaven is within you".

[8:196] The inner man consists of nothing but contemplation.

[8:197] The kingdom of the heavens, then, must be contemplation.

[8:198] Now we behold their shadows as in a glass; hereafter, set free from this earthly body, clad in the incorruptible and the immortal, we shall behold their archetypes, we shall see them, that is, if we have steered our own life's course aright, and if we have heeded the right faith, for otherwise none shall see the Lord.

[8:199] For, it is said, into a malicious soul Wisdom shall not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.

[8:200] And let no one urge in objection that, while I am ignoring what is before our eyes, I am philosophizing to them about bodiless and immaterial being.

[8:201] It seems to me perfectly absurd, while the senses are allowed free action in relation to their proper matter, to exclude mind alone from its peculiar operation.

[8:202] Precisely in the same manner in which sense touches sensible objects, so mind apprehends the objects of mental perception.

[8:203] This too must be said that God our Creator has not included natural faculties among things which can be taught.

[8:204] No one teaches sight to apprehend colour or form, nor hearing to apprehend sound and speech, nor smell, pleasant and unpleasant scents, nor taste, flavours and savours, nor touch, soft and hard, hot and cold.

[8:205] Nor would any one teach the mind to reach objects of mental perception; and just as the senses in the case of their being in any way diseased, or injured, require only proper treatment and then readily fulfil their own functions; just so the mind, imprisoned in flesh, and full of the thoughts that arise thence, requires faith and right conversation which make "its feet like hinds' feet, and set it on its high places".

[8:206] The same advice is given us by Solomon the wise, who in one passage offers us the example of the diligent worker the ant, and recommends her active life; and in another the work of the wise bee in forming its cells, and thereby suggests a natural contemplation wherein also the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is contained, if at least the Creator is considered in proportion to the beauty of the things created.

[8:207] But with thanks to the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost let me make an end to my letter, for, as the proverb has it, πᾶν μέτρον ἄριστον.

[9:1] Letter IX.

[9:2] To Maximus the Philosopher.

[9:3] 1.

[9:4] Speech is really an image of mind: so I have learned to know you from your letters, just as the proverb tells us we may know "the lion from his claws".

[9:5] I am delighted to find that your strong inclinations lie in the direction of the first and greatest of good things—love both to God and to your neighbour.

[9:6] Of the latter I find proof in your kindness to myself; of the former, in your zeal for knowledge.

[9:7] It is well known to every disciple of Christ that in these two all is contained.

[9:8] 2.

[9:9] You ask for the writings of Dionysius; they did indeed reach me, and a great many they were; but I have not the books with me, and so have not sent them.

[9:10] My opinion is, however, as follows.

[9:11] I do not admire everything that is written; indeed of some things I totally disapprove.

[9:12] For it may be, that of the impiety of which we are now hearing so much, I mean the Anomoean, it is he, as far as I know, who first gave men the seeds.

[9:13] I do not trace his so doing to any mental depravity, but only to his earnest desire to resist Sabellius.

[9:14] I often compare him to a woodman trying to straighten some ill-grown sapling, pulling so immoderately in the opposite direction as to exceed the mean, and so dragging the plant awry on the other side.

[9:15] This is very much what we find to be the case with Dionysius.

[9:16] While vehemently opposing the impiety of the Libyan, he is carried away unawares by his zeal into the opposite error.

[9:17] It would have been quite sufficient for him to have pointed out that the Father and the Son are not identical in substance, and thus to score against the blasphemer.

[9:18] But, in order to win an unmistakable and superabundant victory, he is not satisfied with laying down a difference of hypostases, but must needs assert also difference of substance, diminution of power, and variableness of glory.

[9:19] So he exchanges one mischief for another, and diverges from the right line of doctrine.

[9:20] In his writings he exhibits a miscellaneous inconsistency, and is at one time to be found disloyal to the homoousion, because of his opponent who made a bad use of it to the destruction of the hypostases, and at another admitting it in his Apology to his namesake.

[9:21] Besides this he uttered very unbecoming words about the Spirit, separating Him from the Godhead, the object of worship, and assigning Him an inferior rank with created and subordinate nature.

[9:22] Such is the man's character.

[9:23] 3.

[9:24] If I must give my own view, it is this.

[9:25] The phrase "like in essence," if it be read with the addition "without any difference," I accept as conveying the same sense as the homoousion, in accordance with the sound meaning of the homoousion.

[9:26] Being of this mind the Fathers at Nicaea spoke of the Only-begotten as "Light of Light," "Very God of very God," and so on, and then consistently added the homoousion.

[9:27] It is impossible for any one to entertain the idea of variableness of light in relation to light, of truth in relation to truth, nor of the essence of the Only begotten in relation to that of the Father.

[9:28] If, then, the phrase be accepted in this sense, I have no objection to it.

[9:29] But if any one cuts off the qualification "without any difference" from the word "like," as was done at Constantinople, then I regard the phrase with suspicion, as derogatory to the dignity of the Only-begotten.

[9:30] We are frequently accustomed to entertain the idea of "likeness" in the case of indistinct resemblances, coming anything but close to the originals.

[9:31] I am myself for the homoousion, as being less open to improper interpretation.

[9:32] But why, my dear sir, should you not pay me a visit, that we may talk of these high topics face to face, instead of committing them to lifeless letters,—especially when I have determined not to publish my views? And pray do not adopt, to me, the words of Diogenes to Alexander, that "it is as far from you to me as from me to you".

[9:33] I am almost obliged by ill-health to remain like the plants, in one place; moreover I hold "the living unknown" to be one of the chief goods.

[9:34] You, I am told, are in good health; you have made yourself a citizen of the world, and you might consider in coming to see me that you are coming home.

[9:35] It is quite right for you, a man of action, to have crowds and towns in which to show your good deeds.

[9:36] For me, quiet is the best aid for the contemplation and mental exercise whereby I cling to God.

[9:37] This quiet I cultivate in abundance in my retreat, with the aid of its giver, God.

[9:38] Yet if you cannot but court the great, and despise me who lie low upon the ground, then write, and in this way make my life a happier one.

[10:1] Letter X.

[10:2] To a widow.

[10:3] The art of snaring pigeons is as follows.

[10:4] When the men who devote themselves to this craft have caught one, they tame it, and make it feed with them.

[10:5] Then they smear its wings with sweet oil, and let it go and join the rest outside.

[10:6] Then the scent of that sweet oil makes the free flock the possession of the owner of the tame bird, for all the rest are attracted by the fragrance, and settle in the house.

[10:7] But why do I begin my letter thus? Because I have taken your son Dionysius, once Diomedes, and anointed the wings of his soul with the sweet all of God, and sent him to you that you may take flight with him, and make for the nest which he has built under my roof.

[10:8] If I live to see this, and you, my honoured friend, translated to our lofty life, I shall require many persons worthy of God to pay Him all the honour that is His due.

[11:1] Letter XI.

[11:2] Without address.

[11:3] To some friends.

[11:4] After by God's grace I had passed the sacred day with our sons, and had kept a really perfect feast to the Lord because of their exceeding love to God, I sent them in good health to your excellency, with a prayer to our loving God to give them an angel of peace to help and accompany them, and to grant them to find you in good health and assured tranquillity, to the end that wherever your lot may be cast, I to the end of my days, whenever I hear news of you, may be gladdened to think of you as serving and giving thanks to the Lord.

[11:5] If God should grant you to be quickly freed from these cares I beg you to let nothing stand in the way of your coming to stay with me.

[11:6] I think you will find none to love you so well, or to make more of your friendship.

[11:7] So long, then, as the Holy One ordains this separation, be sure that you never lose an opportunity of comforting me by a letter.

[12:1] Letter XII.

[12:2] To Olympius.

[12:3] Before you did write me a few words: now not even a few.

[12:4] Your brevity will soon become silence.

[12:5] Return to your old ways, and do not let me have to scold you for your laconic behaviour.

[12:6] But I shall be glad even of a little letter in token of your great love.

[12:7] Only write to me.

[13:1] Letter XIII.

[13:2] To Olympius.

[13:3] As all the fruits of the season come to us in their proper time, flowers in spring, corn in summer, and apples in autumn, so the fruit for winter is talk.

[14:1] Letter XIV.

[14:2] To Gregory his friend.

[14:3] My brother Gregory writes me word that he has long been wishing to be with me, and adds that you are of the same mind; however, I could not wait, partly as being hard of belief, considering I have been so often disappointed, and partly because I find myself pulled all ways by business.

[14:4] I must at once make for Pontus, where, perhaps, God willing, I may make an end of wandering.

[14:5] After renouncing, with trouble, the idle hopes which I once had, [about you] or rather the dreams, (for it is well said that hopes are waking dreams), I departed into Pontus in quest of a place to live in.

[14:6] There God has opened on me a spot exactly answering to my taste, so that I actually see before my eyes what I have often pictured to my mind in idle fancy.

[14:7] There is a lofty mountain covered with thick woods, watered towards the north with cool and transparent streams.

[14:8] A plain lies beneath, enriched by the waters which are ever draining off from it; and skirted by a spontaneous profusion of trees almost thick enough to be a fence; so as even to surpass Calypso's Island, which Homer seems to have considered the most beautiful spot on the earth.

[14:9] Indeed it is like an island, enclosed as it is on all sides; for deep hollows cut off two sides of it; the river, which has lately fallen down a precipice, runs all along the front and is impassable as a wall; while the mountain extending itself behind, and meeting the hollows in a crescent, stops up the path at its roots.

[14:10] There is but one pass, and I am master of it.

[14:11] Behind my abode there is another gorge, rising into a ledge up above, so as to command the extent of the plains and the stream which bounds it, which is not less beautiful, to my taste, than the Strymon as seen from Amphipolis.

[14:12] For while the latter flows leisurely, and swells into a lake almost, and is too still to be a river, the former is the most rapid stream I know, and somewhat turbid, too, from the rocks just above; from which, shooting down, and eddying in a deep pool, it forms a most pleasant scene for myself or any one else; and is an inexhaustible resource to the country people, in the countless fish which its depths contain.

[14:13] What need to tell of the exhalations from the earth, or the breezes from the river? Another might admire the multitude of flowers, and singing birds; but leisure I have none for such thoughts.

[14:14] However, the chief praise of the place is, that being happily disposed for produce of every kind, it nurtures what to me is the sweetest produce of all, quietness; indeed, it is not only rid of the bustle of the city, but is even unfrequented by travellers, except a chance hunter.

[14:15] It abounds indeed in game, as well as other things, but not, I am glad to say, in bears or wolves, such as you have, but in deer, and wild goats, and hares, and the like.

[14:16] Does it not strike you what a foolish mistake I was near making when I was eager to change this spot for your Tiberina, the very pit of the whole earth?  Pardon me, then, if I am now set upon it; for not Alcmaeon himself, I suppose, could endure to wander further when he had found the Echinades.

[15:1] Letter XV.

[15:2] To Arcadius, Imperial Treasurer.

[15:3] The townsmen of our metropolis have conferred on me a greater favour than they have received, in giving me an opportunity of writing to your excellency.

[15:4] The kindness, to win which they have received this letter from me, was assured them even before I wrote, on account of your wonted and inborn courtesy to all.

[15:5] But I have considered it a very great advantage to have the opportunity of addressing your excellency, praying to the holy God that I may continue to rejoice, and share in the pleasure of the recipients of your bounty, while you please Him more and more, and while the splendour of your high place continues to increase.

[15:6] I pray that in due time I may with joy once more welcome those who are delivering this my letter into your hands, and send them forth praising, as do many, your considerate treatment of them, and I trust that they will have found my recommendation of them not without use in approaching your exalted excellency.

[16:1] Letter XVI.

[16:2] Against Eunomius the heretic.

[16:3] He who maintains that it is possible to arrive at the discovery of things actually existing, has no doubt by some orderly method advanced his intelligence by means of the knowledge of actually existing things.

[16:4] It is after first training himself by the apprehension of small and easily comprehensible objects, that he brings his apprehensive faculty to bear on what is beyond all intelligence.

[16:5] He makes his boast that he has really arrived at the comprehension of actual existences; let him then explain to us the nature of the least of visible beings; let him tell us all about the ant.

[16:6] Does its life depend on breath and breathing? Has it a skeleton? Is its body connected by sinews and ligaments? Are its sinews surrounded with muscles and glands? Does its marrow go with dorsal vertebrae from brow to tail? Does it give impulse to its moving members by the enveloping nervous membrane? Has it a liver, with a gall bladder near the liver? Has it kidneys, heart, arteries, veins, membranes, cartilages? Is it hairy or hairless? Has it an uncloven hoof, or are its feet divided? How long does it live? What is its mode of reproduction? What is its period of gestation? How is it that ants neither all walk nor all fly, but some belong to creeping things, and some travel through the air? The man who glories in his knowledge of the really-existing ought to tell us in the meanwhile about the nature of the ant.

[16:7] Next let him give us a similar physiological account of the power that transcends all human intelligence.

[16:8] But if your knowledge has not yet been able to apprehend the nature of the insignificant ant, how can you boast yourself able to form a conception of the power of the incomprehensible God?.

[17:1] Letter XVII.

[17:2] To Origenes.

[17:3] It is delightful to listen to you, and delightful to read you; and I think you give me the greater pleasure by your writings.

[17:4] All thanks to our good God Who has not suffered the truth to suffer in consequence of its betrayal by the chief powers in the State, but by your means has made the defence of the doctrine of true religion full and satisfactory.

[17:5] Like hemlock, monkshood, and other poisonous herbs, after they have bloomed for a little while, they will quickly wither away.

[17:6] But the reward which the Lord will give you in requital of all that you have said in defence of His name blooms afresh for ever.

[17:7] Wherefore I pray God grant you all happiness in your home, and make His blessing descend to your sons.

[17:8] I was delighted to see and embrace those noble boys, express images of your excellent goodness, and my prayers for them ask all that their father can ask.

[18:1] Letter XVIII.

[18:2] To Macarius and John.

[18:3] The labours of the field come as no novelty to tillers of the land; sailors are not astonished if they meet a storm at sea; sweats in the summer heat are the common experience of the hired hind; and to them that have chosen to live a holy life the afflictions of this present world cannot come unforeseen.

[18:4] Each and all of these have the known and proper labour of their callings, not chosen for its own sake, but for the sake of the enjoyment of the good things to which they look forward.

[18:5] What in each of these cases acts as a consolation in trouble is that which really forms the bond and link of all human life,—hope.

[18:6] Now of them that labour for the fruits of the earth, or for earthly things, some enjoy only in imagination what they have looked for, and are altogether disappointed; and even in the case of others, where the issue has answered expectation, another hope is soon needed, so quickly has the first fled and faded out of sight.

[18:7] Only of them that labour for holiness and truth are the hopes destroyed by no deception; no issue can destroy their labours, for the kingdom of the heavens that awaits them is firm and sure.

[18:8] So long then as the word of truth is on our side, never be in any wise distressed at the calumny of a lie; let no imperial threats scare you; do not be grieved at the laughter and mockery of your intimates, nor at the condemnation of those who pretend to care for you, and who put forward, as their most attractive bait to deceive, a pretence of giving good advice.

[18:9] Against them all let sound reason do battle, invoking the championship and succour of our Lord Jesus Christ, the teacher of true religion, for Whom to suffer is sweet, and "to die is gain".

[19:1] Letter XIX.

[19:2] To Gregory my friend.

[19:3] I received a letter from you the day before yesterday.

[19:4] It is shewn to be yours not so much by the handwriting as by the peculiar style.

[19:5] Much meaning is expressed in few words.

[19:6] I did not reply on the spot, because I was away from home, and the letter-carrier, after he had delivered the packet to one of my friends, went away.

[19:7] Now, however, I am able to address you through Peter, and at the same time both to return your greeting, and give you an opportunity for another letter.

[19:8] There is certainly no trouble in writing a laconic dispatch like those which reach me from you.

[20:1] Letter XX.

[20:2] To Leontius the Sophist.

[20:3] I too do not write often to you, but not more seldom than you do to me, though many have travelled hitherward from your part of the world.

[20:4] If you had sent a letter by every one of them, one after the other, there would have been nothing to prevent my seeming to be actually in your company, and enjoying it as though we had been together, so uninterrupted has been the stream of arrivals.

[20:5] But why do you not write? It is no trouble to a Sophist to write.

[20:6] Nay, if your hand is tired, you need not even write; another will do that for you.

[20:7] Only your tongue is needed.

[20:8] And though it does not speak to me, it may assuredly speak to one of your companions.

[20:9] If nobody is with you, it will talk by itself.

[20:10] Certainly the tongue of a Sophist and of an Athenian is as little likely to be quiet as the nightingales when the spring stirs them to song.

[20:11] In my own case, the mass of business in which I am now engaged may perhaps afford some excuse for my lack of letters.

[20:12] And peradventure the fact of my style having been spoilt by constant familiarity with common speech may make me somewhat hesitate to address Sophists like you, who are certain to be annoyed and unmerciful, unless you hear something worthy of your wisdom.

[20:13] You, on the other hand, ought assuredly to use every opportunity of making your voice heard abroad, for you are the best speaker of all the Hellenes that I know; and I think I know the most renowned among you; so that there really is no excuse for your silence.

[20:14] But enough on this point.

[20:15] I have sent you my writings against Eunomius.

[20:16] Whether they are to be called child's play, or something a little more serious, I leave you to judge.

[20:17] So far as concerns yourself, I do not think you stand any longer in need of them; but I hope they will be no unworthy weapon against any perverse men with whom you may fall in.

[20:18] I do not say this so much because I have confidence in the force of my treatise, as because I know well that you are a man likely to make a little go a long way.

[20:19] If anything strikes you as weaker than it ought to be, pray have no hesitation in showing me the error.

[20:20] The chief difference between a friend and a flatterer is this; the flatterer speaks to please, the friend will not leave out even what is disagreeable.

[21:1] Letter XXI.

[21:2] To Leontius the Sophist.

[21:3] The excellent Julianus seems to get some good for his private affairs out of the general condition of things.

[21:4] Everything nowadays is full of taxes demanded and called in, and he too is vehemently dunned and indicted.

[21:5] Only it is a question not of arrears of rates and taxes, but of letters.

[21:6] But how he comes to be a defaulter I do not know.

[21:7] He has always paid a letter, and received a letter—as he has this.

[21:8] But possibly you have a preference for the famous "four-times-as-much".

[21:9] For even the Pythagoreans were not so fond of their Tetractys, as these modern tax-collectors of their "four-times-as-much".

[21:10] Yet perhaps the fairer thing would have been just the opposite, that a Sophist like you, so very well furnished with words, should be bound in pledge to me for "four-times-as-much".

[21:11] But do not suppose for a moment that I am writing all this out of ill-humour.

[21:12] I am only too pleased to get even a scolding from you.

[21:13] The good and beautiful do everything, it is said, with the addition of goodness and beauty.

[21:14] Even grief and anger in them are becoming.

[21:15] At all events any one would rather see his friend angry with him than any one else flattering him.

[21:16] Do not then cease preferring charges like the last! The very charge will mean a letter; and nothing can be more precious or delightful to me.

[22:1] Letter XXII.

[22:2] Without address.

[22:3] On the Perfection of the Life of Solitaries.

[22:4] 1.

[22:5] Many things are set forth by inspired Scripture as binding upon all who are anxious to please God.

[22:6] But, for the present, I have only deemed it necessary to speak by way of brief reminder concerning the questions which have recently been stirred among you, so far as I have learnt from the study of inspired Scripture itself.

[22:7] I shall thus leave behind me detailed evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their turn will be able to inform others.

[22:8] The Christian ought to be so minded as becomes his heavenly calling, and his life and conversation ought to be worthy of the Gospel of Christ.

[22:9] The Christian ought not to be of doubtful mind, nor by anything drawn away from the recollection of God and of His purposes and judgments.

[22:10] The Christian ought in all things to become superior to the righteousness existing under the law, and neither swear nor lie.

[22:11] He ought not to speak evil; to do violence; to fight; to avenge himself; to return evil for evil; to be angry.

[22:12] The Christian ought to be patient, whatever he have to suffer, and to convict the wrong-doer in season, not with the desire of his own vindication, but of his brother's reformation, according to the commandment of the Lord.

[22:13] The Christian ought not to say anything behind his brother's back with the object of calumniating him, for this is slander, even if what is said is true.

[22:14] He ought to turn away from the brother who speaks evil against him; he ought not to indulge in jesting; he ought not to laugh nor even to suffer laugh makers.

[22:15] He must not talk idly, saying things which are of no service to the hearers nor to such usage as is necessary and permitted us by God; so that workers may do their best as far as possible to work in silence; and that good words be suggested to them by those who are entrusted with the duty of carefully dispensing the word to the building up of the faith, lest God's Holy Spirit be grieved.

[22:16] Any one who comes in ought not to be able, of his own free will, to accost or speak to any of the brothers, before those to whom the responsibility of general discipline is committed have approved of it as pleasing to God, with a view to the common good.

[22:17] The Christian ought not to be enslaved by wine; nor to be eager for flesh meat, and as a general rule ought not to be a lover of pleasure in eating or drinking, "for every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things".

[22:18] The Christian ought to regard all the things that are given him for his use, not as his to hold as his own or to lay up; and, giving careful heed to all things as the Lord's, not to overlook any of the things that are being thrown aside and disregarded, should this be the case.

[22:19] No Christian ought to think of himself as his own master, but each should rather so think and act as though given by God to be slave to his like minded brethren; but "every man in his own order".

[22:20] 2.

[22:21] The Christian ought never to murmur either in scarcity of necessities, or in toil or labour, for the responsibility in these matters lies with such as have authority in them.

[22:22] There never ought to be any clamour, or any behaviour or agitation by which anger is expressed, or diversion of mind from the full assurance of the presence of God.

[22:23] The voice should be modulated; no one ought to answer another, or do anything, roughly or contemptuously, but in all things moderation and respect should be shewn to every one.

[22:24] No wily glances of the eye are to be allowed, nor any behaviour or gestures which grieve a brother and shew contempt.

[22:25] Any display in cloak or shoes is to be avoided; it is idle ostentation.

[22:26] Cheap things ought to be used for bodily necessity; and nothing ought to be spent beyond what is necessary, or for mere extravagance; this is a misuse of our property.

[22:27] The Christian ought not to seek for honour, or claim precedence.

[22:28] Every one ought to put all others before himself.

[22:29] The Christian ought not to be unruly.

[22:30] He who is able to work ought not to eat the bread of idleness, but even he who is busied in deeds well done for the glory of Christ ought to force himself to the active discharge of such work as he can do.

[22:31] Every Christian, with the approval of his superiors, ought so to do everything with reason and assurance, even down to actual eating and drinking, as done to the glory of God.

[22:32] The Christian ought not to change over from one work to another without the approval of those who are appointed for the arrangement of such matters; unless some unavoidable necessity suddenly summon any one to the relief of the helpless.

[22:33] Every one ought to remain in his appointed post, not to go beyond his own bounds and intrude into what is not commanded him, unless the responsible authorities judge any one to be in need of aid.

[22:34] No one ought to be found going from one workshop to another.

[22:35] Nothing ought to be done in rivalry or strife with any one.

[22:36] 3.

[22:37] The Christian ought not to grudge another's reputation, nor rejoice over any man's faults; he ought in Christ's love to grieve and be afflicted at his brother's faults, and rejoice over his brother's good deeds.

[22:38] He ought not to be indifferent or silent before sinners.

[22:39] He who shows another to be wrong ought to do so with all tenderness, in the fear of God, and with the object of converting the sinner.

[22:40] He who is proved wrong or rebuked ought to take it willingly, recognizing his own gain in being set right.

[22:41] When any one is being accused, it is not right for another, before him or any one else, to contradict the accuser; but if at any time the charge seems groundless to any one, he ought privately to enter into discussion with the accuser, and either produce, or acquire, conviction.

[22:42] Every one ought, as far as he is able, to conciliate one who has ground of complaint against him.

[22:43] No one ought to cherish a grudge against the sinner who repents, but heartily to forgive him.

[22:44] He who says that he has repented of a sin ought not only to be pricked with compunction for his sin, but also to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.

[22:45] He who has been corrected in first faults, and received pardon, if he sins again prepares for himself a judgment of wrath worse than the former.

[22:46] He, who after the first and second admonition abides in his fault, ought to be brought before the person in authority, if haply after being rebuked by more he may be ashamed.

[22:47] If even thus he fail to be set right he is to be cut off from the rest as one that maketh to offend, and regarded as a heathen and a publican, for the security of them that are obedient, according to the saying, When the impious fall the righteous tremble.

[22:48] He should be grieved over as a limb cut from the body.

[22:49] The sun ought not to go down upon a brother's wrath, lest haply night come between brother and brother, and make the charge stand in the day of judgment.

[22:50] A Christian ought not to wait for an opportunity for his own amendment, because there is no certainty about the morrow; for many after many devices have not reached the morrow.

[22:51] He ought not to be beguiled by over eating, whence come dreams in the night.

[22:52] He ought not to be distracted by immoderate toil, nor overstep the bounds of sufficiency, as the apostle says, "Having food and raiment let us be therewith content;" unnecessary abundance gives appearance of covetousness, and covetousness is condemned as idolatry.

[22:53] A Christian ought not to be a lover of money, nor lay up treasure for unprofitable ends.

[22:54] He who comes to God ought to embrace poverty in all things, and to be riveted in the fear of God, according to the words, "Rivet my flesh in thy fear, for I am afraid of thy judgments".

[22:55] The Lord grant that you may receive what I have said with full conviction and shew forth fruits worthy of the Spirit to the glory of God, by God's good pleasure, and the cooperation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[23:1] Letter XXIII.

[23:2] To a Solitary.

[23:3] A certain man, as he says, on condemning the vanity of this life, and perceiving that its joys are ended here, since they only provide material for eternal fire and then quickly pass away, has come to me with the desire of separating from this wicked and miserable life, of abandoning the pleasures of the flesh, and of treading for the future a road which leads to the mansions of the Lord.

[23:4] Now if he is sincerely firm in his truly blessed purpose, and has in his soul the glorious and laudable passion, loving the Lord his God with all his heart, with all his strength, and with all his mind, it is necessary for your reverence to show him the difficulties and distresses of the strait and narrow way, and establish him in the hope of the good things which are as yet unseen, but are laid up in promise for all that are worthy of the Lord.

[23:5] I therefore write to entreat your incomparable perfection in Christ, if it be possible to mould his character, and, without me, to bring about his renunciation according to what is pleasing to God, and to see that he receive elementary instruction in accordance with what has been decided by the Holy Fathers, and put forth by them in writing.

[23:6] See too that he have put before him all things that are essential to ascetic discipline, and that so he may be introduced to the life, after having accepted, of his own accord, the labours undergone for religion's sake, subjected himself to the Lord's easy yoke, adopted a conversation in imitation of Him Who for our sakes became poor and took flesh, and may run without fail to the prize of his high calling, and receive the approbation of the Lord.

[23:7] He is wishful to receive here the crown of God's loves, but I have put him off, because I wish, in conjunction with your reverence, to anoint him for such struggles, and to appoint over him one of your number whom he may select to be his trainer, training him nobly, and making him by his constant and blessed care a tried wrestler, wounding and overthrowing the prince of the darkness of this world, and the spiritual powers of iniquity, with whom, as the blessed Apostle says, is "our wrestling".

[23:8] What I wish to do in conjunction with you, let your love in Christ do without me.

[24:1] Letter XXIV.

[24:2] To Athanasius, father of Athanasius bishop of Ancyra.

[24:3] That one of the things hardest to achieve, if indeed it be not impossible, is to rise superior to calumny, I am myself fully persuaded, and so too, I presume, is your excellency.

[24:4] Yet not to give a handle by one's own conduct, either to inquisitive critics of society, or to mischief makers who lie in wait to catch us tripping, is not only possible, but is the special characteristic of all who order their lives wisely and according to the rule of true religion.

[24:5] And do not think me so simple and credulous as to accept depreciatory remarks from any one without due investigation.

[24:6] I bear in mind the admonition of the Spirit, "Thou shalt not receive a false report".

[24:7] But you, learned men, yourselves say that "The seen is significant of the unseen".

[24:8] I therefore beg;—(and pray do not take it ill if I seem to be speaking as though I were giving a lesson; for "God has chosen the weak" and "despised things of the world," and often by their means brings about the salvation of such as are being saved); what I say and urge is this; that by word and deed we act with scrupulous attention to propriety, and, in accordance with the apostolic precept, "give no offence in anything".

[24:9] The life of one who has toiled hard in the acquisition of knowledge, who has governed cities and states, and who is jealous of the high character of his forefathers, ought to be an example of high character itself.

[24:10] You ought not now to be exhibiting your disposition towards your children in word only, as you have long exhibited its ever since you became a father; you ought not only to shew that natural affection which is shewn by brutes, as you yourself have said, and as experience shews.

[24:11] You ought to make your love go further, and be a love all the more personal and voluntary in that you see your children worthy of a father's prayers.

[24:12] On this point I do not need to be convinced.

[24:13] The evidence of facts is enough.

[24:14] One thing, however, I will say for truth's sake, that it is not our brother Timotheus, the Chorepiscopus, who has brought me word of what is noised abroad.

[24:15] For neither by word of mouth nor by letter has he ever conveyed anything in the shape of slander, be it small or great.

[24:16] That I have heard something I do not deny, but it is not Timotheus who accuses you.

[24:17] Yet while I hear whatever I do, at least I will follow the example of Alexander, and will keep one ear clear for the accused.

[25:1] Letter XXV.

[25:2] To Athanasius, bishop of Ancyra.

[25:3] 1.

[25:4] I have received intelligence from those who come to me from Ancyra, and they are many and more than I can count, but they all agree in what they say, that you, a man very dear to me, (how can I speak so as to give no offence?) do not mention me in very pleasant terms, nor yet in such as your character would lead me to expect.

[25:5] I, however, learned long ago the weakness of human nature, and its readiness to turn from one extreme to another; and so, be well assured, nothing connected with it can astonish me, nor does any change come quite unexpected.

[25:6] Therefore that my lot should have changed for the worse, and that reproaches and insults should have arisen in the place of former respect, I do not make much ado.

[25:7] But one thing does really strike me as astonishing and monstrous, and that is that it should be you who have this mind about me, and go so far as to feel anger and indignation against me, and, if the report of your hearers is to be believed, have already proceeded to such extremities as to utter threats.

[25:8] At these threats, I will not deny, I really have laughed.

[25:9] Truly I should have been but a boy to be frightened at such bugbears.

[25:10] But it does seem to me alarming and distressing that you, who, as I have trusted, are preserved for the comfort of the churches, a buttress of the truth where many fall away, and a seed of the ancient and true love, should so far fall in with the present course of events as to be more influenced by the calumny of the first man you come across than by your long knowledge of me, and, without any proof, should be seduced into suspecting absurdities.

[25:11] 2.

[25:12] But, as I said, for the present I postpone the case.

[25:13] Would it have been too hard a task, my dear sir, to discuss in a short letter, as between friend and friend, points which you wish to raise; or, if you objected to entrusting such things to writing, to get me to come to you? But if you could not help speaking out, and your uncontrollable anger allowed no time for delay, at least you might have employed one of those about you who are naturally adapted for dealing with confidential matters, as a means of communication with me.

[25:14] But now, of all those who for one reason or another approach you, into whose ears has it not been dinned that I am a writer and composer of certain "pests"? For this is the word which those, who quote you word for word, say that you have used.

[25:15] The more I bring my mind to bear upon the matter the more hopeless is my puzzle.

[25:16] This idea has struck me.

[25:17] Can any heretic have grieved your orthodoxy, and driven you to the utterance of that word by malevolently putting my name to his own writings? For you, a man who has sustained great and famous contests on behalf of the truth, could never have endured to inflict such an outrage on what I am well known to have written against those who dare to say that God the Son is in essence unlike God the Father, or who blasphemously describe the Holy Ghost as created and made.

[25:18] You might relieve me from my difficulty yourself, if you would tell me plainly what it is that has stirred you to be thus offended with me.

[26:1] Letter XXVI.

[26:2] To Caesarius, brother of Gregory.

[26:3] Thanks to God for shewing forth His wonderful power in your person, and for preserving you to your country and to us your friends, from so terrible a death.

[26:4] It remains for us not to be ungrateful, nor unworthy of so great a kindness, but, to the best of our ability, to narrate the marvellous works of God, to celebrate by deed the kindness which we have experienced, and not return thanks by word only.

[26:5] We ought to become in very deed what I, grounding my belief on the miracles wrought in you, am persuaded that you now are.

[26:6] We exhort you still more to serve God, ever increasing your fear more and more, and advancing on to perfection, that we may be made wise stewards of our life, for which the goodness of God has reserved us.

[26:7] For if it is a command to all of us "to yield ourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead," how much more strongly is not this commanded them who have been lifted up from the gates of death? And this, I believe, would be best effected, did we but desire ever to keep the same mind in which we were at the moment of our perils.

[26:8] For, I ween, the vanity of our life came before us, and we felt that all that belongs to man, exposed as it is to vicissitudes, has about it nothing sure, nothing firm.

[26:9] We felt, as was likely, repentance for the past; and we gave a promise for the future, if we were saved, to serve God and give careful heed to ourselves.

[26:10] If the imminent peril of death gave me any cause for reflection, I think that you must have been moved by the same or nearly the same thoughts.

[26:11] We are therefore bound to pay a binding debt, at once joyous at God's good gift to us, and, at the same time, anxious about the future.

[26:12] I have ventured to make these suggestions to you.

[26:13] It is yours to receive what I say well and kindly, as you were wont to do when we talked together face to face.

[27:1] Letter XXVII.

[27:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[27:3] When by God's grace, and the aid of your prayers, I had seemed to be somewhat recovering from my sickness, and had got my strength again, then came winter, keeping me a prisoner at home, and compelling me to remain where I was.

[27:4] True, its severity was much less than usual, but this was quite enough to keep me not merely from travelling while it lasted, but even from so much as venturing to put my head out of doors.

[27:5] But to me it is no slight thing to be permitted, if only by letter, to communicate with your reverence, and to rest tranquil in the hope of your reply.

[27:6] However, should the season permit, and further length of life be allowed me, and should the dearth not prevent me from undertaking the journey, peradventure through the aid of your prayers I may be able to fulfil my earnest wish, may find you at your own fireside, and, with abundant leisure, may take my fill of your vast treasures of wisdom.

[28:1] Letter XXVIII.

[28:2] To the Church of Neocaesarea.

[28:3] Consolatory.

[28:4] 1.

[28:5] What has befallen you strongly moved me to visit you, with the double object of joining with you, who are near and dear to me, in paying all respect to the blessed dead, and of being more closely associated with you in your trouble by seeing your sorrow with my own eyes, and so being able to take counsel with you as to what is to be done.

[28:6] But many causes hinder my being able to approach you in person, and it remains for me to communicate with you in writing.

[28:7] The admirable qualities of the departed, on account of which we chiefly estimate the greatness of our loss, are indeed too many to be enumerated in a letter; and it is, besides, no time to be discussing the multitude of his good deeds, when our spirits are thus prostrated with grief.

[28:8] For of all that he did, what can we ever forget? What could we deem deserving of silence? To tell all at once were impossible; to tell a part would, I fear, involve disloyalty to the truth.

[28:9] A man has passed away who surpassed all his contemporaries in all the good things that are within man's reach; a prop of his country; an ornament of the churches; a pillar and support of the truth; a stay of the faith of Christ; a protector of his friends; a stout foe of his opponents; a guardian of the principles of his fathers; an enemy of innovation; exhibiting in himself the ancient fashion of the Church, and making the state of the Church put under him conform to the ancient constitution, as to a sacred model, so that all who lived with him seemed to live in the society of them that used to shine like lights in the world two hundred years ago and more.

[28:10] So your bishop put forth nothing of his own, no novel invention; but, as the blessing of Moses has it, he knew how to bring out of the secret and good stores of his heart, "old store, and the old because of the new".

[28:11] Thus it came about that in meetings of his fellow bishops he was not ranked according to his age, but, by reason of the old age of his wisdom, he was unanimously conceded precedence over all the rest.

[28:12] And no one who looks at your condition need go far to seek the advantages of such a course of training.

[28:13] For, so far as I know, you alone, or, at all events, you and but very few others, in the midst of such a storm and whirlwind of affairs, were able under his good guidance to live your lives unshaken by the waves.

[28:14] You were never reached by heretics' buffering blasts, which bring shipwreck and drowning on unstable souls; and that you may for ever live beyond their reach I pray the Lord who ruleth over all, and who granted long tranquillity to Gregory His servant, the first founder of your church.

[28:15] Do not lose that tranquillity now; do not, by extravagant lamentation, and by entirely giving yourself up to grief, put the opportunity for action into the hands of those who are plotting your bane.

[28:16] If lament you must, (which I do not allow, lest you be in this respect like "them which have no hope,") do you, if so it seem good to you, like some wading chorus, choose your leader, and raise with him a chant of tears.

[28:17] 2.

[28:18] And yet, if he whom you mourn had not reached extreme old age, certainly, as regards his government of your church, he was allowed no narrow limit of life.

[28:19] He had as much strength of body as enabled him to show strength of mind in his distresses.

[28:20] Perhaps some of you may suppose that time increases sympathy and adds affection, and is no cause of satiety, so that, the longer you have experienced kind treatment, the more sensible you are of its loss.

[28:21] You may think that of a righteous person the good hold even the shadow in honour.

[28:22] Would that many of you did feel so! Far be it from me to suggest anything like disregard of our friend! But I do counsel you to bear your pain with manly endurance.

[28:23] I myself am by no means insensible of all that may be said by those who are weeping for their loss.

[28:24] Hushed is a tongue whose words flooded our ears like a mighty stream: a depth of heart, never fathomed before, has fled, humanly speaking, like an unsubstantial dream.

[28:25] Whose glance so keen as his to look into the future? Who with like fixity and strength of mind able to dart like lightning into the midst of action? O Neocaesarea, already a prey to many troubles, never before smitten with so deadly a loss! Now withered is the bloom of you, beauty; your church is dumb; your assemblies are full of mournful faces; your sacred synod craves for its leader; your holy utterances wait for an expounder; your boys have lost a father, your elders a brother, your nobles one first among them, your people a champion, your poor a supporter.

[28:26] All, calling him by the name that comes most nearly home to each, lift up the wailing cry which to each man's own sorrow seems most appropriate and fit.

[28:27] But whither are my words carried away by my tearful joy? Shall we not watch? Shall we not meet together? Shall we not look to our common Lord, Who suffers each of his saints to serve his own generation, and summons him back to Himself at His own appointed time? Now in season remember the voice of him who when preaching to you used always to say "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers".

[28:28] The dogs are many.

[28:29] Why do I say dogs? Rather grievous wolves, hiding their guile under the guise of sheep, are, all over the world, tearing Christ's flock.

[28:30] Of these you must beware, under the protection of some wakeful bishop.

[28:31] Such an one it is yours to ask, purging your souls of all rivalry and ambition: such an one it is the Lord's to show you.

[28:32] That Lord, from the time of Gregory the great champion of your church down to that of the blessed departed, setting over you one after another, and from time to time fitting one to another like gem set close to gem, has bestowed on you glorious ornaments for your church.

[28:33] You have, then, no need to despair of them that are to come.

[28:34] The Lord knoweth who are His.

[28:35] He may bring into our midst those for whom peradventure we are not looking.

[28:36] 3.

[28:37] I meant to have come to an end long before this, but the pain at my heart does not allow me.

[28:38] Now I charge you by the Fathers, by the true faith, by our blessed friend, lift up your souls, each man making what is being done his own immediate business, each reckoning that he will be the first to reap the consequences of the issue, whichever way it turn out, lest your fate be that which so very frequently befalls, every one leaving to his neighbour the common interests of all; and then, while each one makes little in his own mind of what is going on, all of you unwittingly draw your own proper misfortunes on yourselves by your neglect.

[28:39] Take, I beg you, what I say with all kindliness, whether it be regarded as an expression of the sympathy of a neighbour, or as fellowship between fellow believers, or, which is really nearer the truth, of one who obeys the law of love, and shrinks from the risk of silence.

[28:40] I am persuaded that you are my boasting, as I am yours, till the day of the Lord, and that it depends upon the pastor who will be granted you whether I shall be more closely united to you by the bond of love, or wholly severed from you.

[28:41] This latter God forbid.

[28:42] By God's grace it will not so be; and I should be sorry now to say one ungracious word.

[28:43] But this I do wish you to know, that though I had not that blessed man always at my side, in my efforts for the peace of the churches, because, as he himself affirmed, of certain prejudices, yet, nevertheless, at no time did I fail in unity of opinion with him, and I have always invoked his aid in my struggles against the heretics.

[28:44] Of this I call to witness God and all who know me best.

[29:1] Letter XXIX.

[29:2] To the Church of Ancyra.

[29:3] Consolatory.

[29:4] My amazement at the most distressing news of the calamity which has befallen you for a long time kept me silent.

[29:5] I felt like a man whose ears are stunned by a loud clap of thunder.

[29:6] Then I somehow recovered a little from my state of speechlessness.

[29:7] Now I have mourned, as none could help mourning, over the event, and, in the midst of my lamentations, have sent you this letter.

[29:8] I write not so much to console you,—for who could find words to cure a calamity so great?—as to signify to you, as well as I can by these means, the agony of my own heart.

[29:9] I need now the lamentations of Jeremiah, or of any other of the Saints who has feelingly lamented a great woe.

[29:10] A man has fallen who was really a pillar and stay of the Church or rather he himself has been taken from us and is gone to the blessed life, and there is no small danger lest many at the removal of this prop from under them fall too, and lest some men's unsoundness be brought to light.

[29:11] A mouth is sealed gushing with righteous eloquence and words of grace to the edification of the brotherhood.

[29:12] Gone are the counsels of a mind which truly moved in God.

[29:13] Ah! how often, for I must accuse myself, was it my lot to feel indignation against him, because, wholly desiring to depart and be with Christ, he did not prefer for our sakes to remain in the flesh! To whom for the future shall I commit the cares of the Churches? Whom shall I take to share my troubles? Whom to participate in my gladness? O loneliness terrible and sad! How am I not like to a pelican of the wilderness? Yet of a truth the members of the Church, united by his leadership as by one soul, and fitted together into close union of feeling and fellowship, are both preserved and shall ever be preserved by the bond of peace for spiritual communion.

[29:14] God grants us the boon, that all the works of that blessed soul, which he did nobly in the churches of God, abide firm and immovable.

[29:15] But the struggle is no slight one, lest, once more strifes and divisions arising over the choice of the bishop, all your work be upset by some quarrel.

[30:1] Letter XXX.

[30:2] To Eusebius of Samosata.

[30:3] If I were to write at length all the causes which, up to the present time, have kept me at home, eager as I have been to set out to see your reverence, I should tell an interminable story.

[30:4] I say nothing of illnesses coming one upon another, hard winter weather, and press of work, for all this has been already made known to you.

[30:5] Now, for my sins, I have lost my Mother, the only comfort I had in life.

[30:6] Do not smile, if, old as I am, I lament my orphanhood.

[30:7] Forgive me if I cannot endure separation from a soul, to compare with whom I see nothing in the future that lies before me.

[30:8] So once more my complaints have come back to me; once more I am confined to my bed, tossing about in my weakness, and every hour all but looking for the end of life; and the Churches are in somewhat the same condition as my body, no good hope shining on them, and their state always changing for the worse.

[30:9] In the meantime Neocaesarea and Ancyra have decided to have successors of the dead, and so far they are at peace.

[30:10] Those who are plotting against me have not yet been permitted to do anything worthy of their bitterness and wrath.

[30:11] This we make no secret of attributing to your prayers on behalf of the Churches.

[30:12] Weary not then in praying for the Churches and in entreating God.

[30:13] Pray give all salutations to those who are privileged to minister to your Holiness.

[31:1] Letter XXXI.

[31:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[31:3] The death is still with us, and I am therefore compelled to remain where I am, partly by the duty of distribution, and partly out of sympathy for the distressed.

[31:4] Even now, therefore, I have not been able to accompany our reverend brother Hypatius, whom I am able to style brother, not in mere conventional language, but on account of relationship, for we are of one blood.

[31:5] You know how ill he is.

[31:6] It distresses me to think that all hope of comfort is cut off for him, as those who have the gifts of healing have not been allowed to apply their usual remedies in his case.

[31:7] Wherefore again he implores the aid of your prayers.

[31:8] Receive my entreaty that you will give him the usual protection alike for your own sake, for you are always kind to the sick, and for mine who am petitioning on his behalf.

[31:9] If possible, summon to your side the very holy brethren that he may be treated under your own eyes.

[31:10] If this be impossible, be so good as to send him on with a letter, and recommend him to friends further on.

[32:1] Letter XXXII.

[32:2] To Sophronius the Master.

[32:3] Our God—beloved brother, Gregory the bishop, shares the troubles of the times, for he too, like everybody else, is distressed at successive outrages, and resembles a man buffeted by unexpected blows.

[32:4] For men who have no fear of God, possibly forced by the greatness of their troubles, are reviling him, on the ground that they have lent Caesarius money.

[32:5] It is not indeed the question of any loss which is serious, for he has long learnt to despise riches.

[32:6] The matter rather is that those who have so freely distributed all the effects of Caesarius that were worth anything, after really getting very little, because his property was in the hands of slaves, and of men of no better character than slaves, did not leave much for the executors.

[32:7] This little they supposed to be pledged to no one, and straightway spent it on the poor, not only from their own preference, but because of the injunctions of the dead.

[32:8] For on his death bed Caesarius is declared to have said "I wish my goods to belong to the poor".

[32:9] In obedience then to the wishes of Caesarius they made a proper distribution of them.

[32:10] Now, with the poverty of a Christian, Gregory is immersed in the bustle of a chafferer.

[32:11] So I bethought me of reporting the matter to your excellency, in order that you may state what you think proper about Gregory to the Comes Thesaurorum, and so may honour a man whom you have known for many years, glorify the Lord who takes as done to Himself what is done to His servants, and honour me who am specially bound to you.

[32:12] You will, I hope, of your great sagacity devise a means of relief from these outrageous people and intolerable annoyances.

[32:13] 2.

[32:14] No one is so ignorant of Gregory as to have any unworthy suspicion of his giving an inexact account of the circumstances because he is fond of money.

[32:15] We have not to go far to find a proof of his liberality.

[32:16] What is left of the property of Caesarius he gladly abandons to the Treasury, so that the property may be kept there, and the Treasurer may give answer to those who attack it and demand their proofs; for we are not adapted for such business.

[32:17] Your excellency may be informed that, so long as it was possible, no one went away without getting what he wanted, and each one carried off what he demanded without any difficulty.

[32:18] The consequence indeed was that a good many were sorry that they had not asked for more at first; and this made still more objectors, for with the example of the earlier successful applicants before them, one false claimant starts up after another.

[32:19] I do then entreat your excellency to make a stand against all this and to come in, like some intervening stream, and solve the continuity of these troubles.

[32:20] You know how best you will help matters, and need not wait to be instructed by me.

[32:21] I am inexperienced in the affairs of this life, and cannot see my way out of our difficulties.

[32:22] Of your great wisdom discover some means of help.

[32:23] Be our counsellor.

[32:24] Be our champion.

[33:1] Letter XXXIII.

[33:2] To Aburgius.

[33:3] Who knows so well as you do how to respect an old friendship, to pay reverence to virtue, and to sympathise with the sick? Now my God-beloved brother Gregory the bishop has become involved in matters which would be under any circumstances disagreeable, and are quite foreign to his bent of mind.

[33:4] I have therefore thought it best to throw myself on your protection, and to endeavour to obtain from you some solution of our difficulties.

[33:5] It is really an intolerable state of things that one who is neither by nature nor inclination adapted for anything of the kind should be compelled to be thus responsible; that demands for money should be made on a poor man; and that one who has long determined to pass his life in retirement should be dragged into publicity.

[33:6] It would depend upon your wise counsel whether you think it of any use to address the Comes Thesaurorum or any other persons.

[34:1] Letter XXXIV.

[34:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[34:3] How could I be silent at the present juncture? And if I cannot be silent, how am I to find utterance adequate to the circumstances, so as to make my voice not like a mere groan but rather a lamentation intelligibly indicating the greatness of the misfortune? Ah me! Tarsus is undone.

[34:4] This is a trouble grievous to be borne, but it does not come alone.

[34:5] It is still harder to think that a city so placed as to be united with Cilicia, Cappadocia, and Assyria, should be lightly thrown away by the madness of two or three individuals, while you are all the while hesitating, settling what to do, and looking at one another's faces.

[34:6] It would have been far better to do like the doctors.

[34:7] (I have been so long an invalid that I have no lack of illustrations of this kind.

[34:8] ) When their patients' pain becomes excessive they produce insensibility; so should we pray that our souls may be made insensible to the pain of our troubles, that we be not put under unendurable agony.

[34:9] In these hard straits I do not fail to use one means of consolation.

[34:10] I look to your kindness; I try to make my troubles milder by my thought and recollection of you.

[34:11] When the eyes have looked intently on any brilliant objects it relieves them to turn again to what is blue and green; the recollection of your kindness and attention has just the same effect on my soul; it is a mild treatment that takes away my pain.

[34:12] I feel this the more when I reflect that you individually have done all that man could do.

[34:13] You have satisfactorily shewn us, men, if we judge things fairly, that the catastrophe is in no way due to you personally.

[34:14] The reward which you have won at God's hand for your zeal for right is no small one.

[34:15] May the Lord grant you to me and to His churches to the improvement of life and the guidance of souls, and may He once more allow me the privilege of meeting you.

[35:1] Letter XXXV.

[35:2] Without address.

[35:3] I have written to you about many people as belonging to myself; now I mean to write about more.

[35:4] The poor can never fail, and I can never say, no.

[35:5] There is no one more intimately associated with me, nor better able to do me kindnesses wherever he has the ability, than the reverend brother Leontius.

[35:6] So treat his house as if you had found me, not in that poverty in which now by God's help I am living, but endowed with wealth and landed property.

[35:7] There is no doubt that you would not have made me poor, but would have taken care of what I had, or even added to my possessions.

[35:8] This is the way I ask you to behave in the house of Leontius.

[35:9] You will get your accustomed reward from me; my prayers to the holy God for the trouble you are taking in shewing yourself a good man and true, and in anticipating the supplication of the needy.

[36:1] Letter XXXVI.

[36:2] Without address.

[36:3] It has, I think, been long known to your excellency that the presbyter of this place is a foster brother of my own.

[36:4] What more can I say to induce you in your kindness, to view him with a friendly eye, and give him help in his affairs? If you love me, as I know you do, I am sure that you will endeavour, to the best of your power, to relieve any one whom I look upon as a second self.

[36:5] What then do I ask? That he do not lose his old rating.

[36:6] Really he takes no little trouble in ministering to my necessities, because I, as you know, have nothing of my own, but depend upon the means of my friends and relatives.

[36:7] Look, then, upon my brother's house as you would on mine, or let me rather say, on your own.

[36:8] In return for your kindness to him God will not cease to help alike yourself, your house, and your family.

[36:9] Be sure that I am specially anxious lest any injury should be done to him by the equalization of rates.

[37:1] Letter XXXVII.

[37:2] Without address.

[37:3] I look with suspicion on the multiplication of letters.

[37:4] Against my will, and because I cannot resist the importunity of petitioners, I am compelled to speak.

[37:5] I write because I can think of no other means of relieving myself than by assenting to the supplications of those who are always asking letters from me.

[37:6] I am really afraid lest, since many are carrying letters off, one of the many be reckoned to be that brother.

[37:7] I have, I own, many friends and relatives in my own country, and I am placed in loco parentis by the position which the Lord has given me.

[37:8] Among them is this my foster brother, son of my nurse, and I pray that the house in which I was brought up may remain at its old assessment, so that the sojourn among us of your excellency, so beneficial to us all, may turn out no occasion of trouble to him.

[37:9] Now too I am supported from the same house, because I have nothing of my own, but depend upon those who love me.

[37:10] I do then entreat you to spare the house in which I was nursed as though you were keeping up the supply of support for me.

[37:11] May God in return grant you His everlasting rest.

[37:12] One thing however, and it is most true, I think your excellency ought to know, and that is that the greater number of the slaves were given him from the outset by us, as an equivalent for my sustenance, by the gift of my father and mother.

[37:13] At the same time this was not to be regarded as an absolute gift; he was only to have the use for life, so that, if anything serious happen to him on their account, he is at liberty to send them back to me, and I shall thus in another way be responsible for rates and to collectors.

[38:1] Letter XXXVIII.

[38:2] To his Brother Gregory, concerning the difference between οὐσία and ὑπόστασις.

[38:3] 1.

[38:4] Many persons, in their study of the sacred dogmas, failing to distinguish between what is common in the essence or substance, and the meaning of the hypostases, arrive at the same notions, and think that it makes no difference whether οὐσία or hypostasis be spoken of.

[38:5] The result is that some of those who accept statements on these subjects without any enquiry, are pleased to speak of "one hypostasis," just as they do of one "essence" or "substance;" while on the other hand those who accept three hypostases are under the idea that they are bound in accordance with this confession, to assert also, by numerical analogy, three essences or substances.

[38:6] Under these circumstances, lest you fall into similar error, I have composed a short treatise for you by way of memorandum.

[38:7] The meaning of the words, to put it shortly, is as follows:  2.

[38:8] Of all nouns the sense of some, which are predicated of subjects plural and numerically various, is more general; as for instance man.

[38:9] When we so say, we employ the noun to indicate the common nature, and do not confine our meaning to any one man in particular who is known by that name.

[38:10] Peter, for instance is no more man, than Andrew, John, or James.

[38:11] The predicate therefore being common, and extending to all the individuals ranked under the same name, requires some note of distinction whereby we may understand not man in general, but Peter or John in particular.

[38:12] Of some nouns on the other hand the denotation is more limited; and by the aid of the limitation we have before our minds not the common nature, but a limitation of anything, having, so far as the peculiarity extends, nothing in common with what is of the same kind; as for instance, Paul or Timothy.

[38:13] For, in a word, of this kind there is no extension to what is common in the nature; there is a separation of certain circumscribed conceptions from the general idea, and expression of them by means of their names.

[38:14] Suppose then that two or more are set together, as, for instance, Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, and that an enquiry is made into the essence or substance of humanity; no one will give one definition of essence or substance in the case of Paul, a second in that of Silvanus, and a third in that of Timothy; but the same words which have been employed in setting forth the essence or substance of Paul will apply to the others also.

[38:15] Those who are described by the same definition of essence or substance are of the same essence or substance when the enquirer has learned what is common, and turns his attention to the differentiating properties whereby one is distinguished from another, the definition by which each is known will no longer tally in all particulars with the definition of another, even though in some points it be found to agree.

[38:16] 3.

[38:17] My statement, then, is this.

[38:18] That which is spoken of in a special and peculiar manner is indicated by the name of the hypostasis.

[38:19] Suppose we say "a man".

[38:20] The indefinite meaning of the word strikes a certain vague sense upon the ears.

[38:21] The nature is indicated, but what subsists and is specially and peculiarly indicated by the name is not made plain.

[38:22] Suppose we say "Paul".

[38:23] We set forth, by what is indicated by the name, the nature subsisting.

[38:24] This then is the hypostasis, or "understanding;" not the indefinite conception of the essence or substance, which, because what is signified is general, finds no "standing," but the conception which by means of the expressed peculiarities gives standing and circumscription to the general and uncircumscribed.

[38:25] It is customary in Scripture to make a distinction of this kind, as well in many other passages as in the History of Job.

[38:26] When purposing to narrate the events of his life, Job first mentions the common, and says "a man;" then he straightway particularizes by adding "a certain".

[38:27] As to the description of the essence, as having no bearing on the scope of his work, he is silent, but by means of particular notes of identity, mentioning the place and points of character, and such external qualifications as would individualize, and separate from the common and general idea, he specifies the "certain man," in such a way that from name, place, mental qualities, and outside circumstances, the description of the man whose life is being narrated is made in all particulars perfectly clear.

[38:28] If he had been giving an account of the essence, there would not in his explanation of the nature have been any mention of these matters.

[38:29] The same moreover would have been the account that there is in the case of Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and each of the men there mentioned.

[38:30] Transfer, then, to the divine dogmas the same standard of difference which you recognise in the case both of essence and of hypostasis in human affairs, and you will not go wrong.

[38:31] Whatever your thought suggests to you as to the mode of the existence of the Father, you will think also in the case of the Son, and in like manner too of the Holy Ghost.

[38:32] For it is idle to bait the mind at any detached conception from the conviction that it is beyond all conception.

[38:33] For the account of the uncreate and of the incomprehensible is one and the same in the case of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

[38:34] For one is not more incomprehensible and uncreate than another.

[38:35] And since it is necessary, by means of the notes of differentiation, in the case of the Trinity, to keep the distinction unconfounded, we shall not take into consideration, in order to estimate that which differentiates, what is contemplated in common, as the uncreate, or what is beyond all comprehension, or any quality of this nature; we shall only direct our attention to the enquiry by what means each particular conception will be lucidly and distinctly separated from that which is conceived of in common.

[38:36] 4.

[38:37] Now the proper way to direct our investigation seems to me to be as follows.

[38:38] We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, "But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will".

[38:39] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God; for we are taught by Holy Scripture that "All things were made by Him," and "by Him consist".

[38:40] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.

[38:41] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination, which is the cause of the cause of all things.

[38:42] For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.

[38:43] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit.

[38:44] Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father.

[38:45] The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost.

[38:46] He alone is known by the stated signs.

[38:47] But God, Who is over all, alone has, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known.

[38:48] Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes.

[38:49] Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous.

[38:50] And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation.

[38:51] Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter.

[38:52] Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness.

[38:53] He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together.

[38:54] He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit.

[38:55] And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God, as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who "draws the Spirit," as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father.

[38:56] And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit.

[38:57] For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit.

[38:58] Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son.

[38:59] But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence.

[38:60] Marvel not then at my speaking of the same thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction.

[38:61] Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.

[38:62] 5.

[38:63] Yet receive what I say as at best a token and reflexion of the truth; not as the actual truth itself.

[38:64] For it is not possible that there should be complete correspondence between what is seen in the tokens and the objects in reference to which the use of tokens is adopted.

[38:65] Why then do I say that an analogy of the separate and the conjoined is found in objects perceptible to the senses? You have before now, in springtime, beheld the brightness of the bow in the cloud; the bow, I mean, which, in our common parlance, is called Iris, and is said by persons skilled in such matters to be formed when a certain moisture is mingled with the air, and the force of the winds expresses what is dense and moist in the vapour, after it has become cloudy, into rain.

[38:66] The bow is said to be formed as follows.

[38:67] When the sunbeam, after traversing obliquely the dense and darkened portion of the cloud-formation, has directly cast its own orb on some cloud, the radiance is then reflected back from what is moist and shining, and the result is a bending and return, as it were, of the light upon itself.

[38:68] For flame-like flashings are so constituted that if they fall on any smooth surface they are refracted on themselves; and the shape of the sun, which by means of the beam is formed on the moist and smooth part of the air, is round.

[38:69] The necessary consequence therefore is that the air adjacent to the cloud is marked out by means of the radiant brilliance in conformity with the shape of the sun's disc.

[38:70] Now this brilliance is both continuous and divided.

[38:71] It is of many colours; it is of many forms; it is insensibly steeped in the variegated bright tints of its dye; imperceptibly abstracting from our vision the combination of many coloured things, with the result that no space, mixing or paring within itself the difference of colour, can be discerned either between blue and flame-coloured, or between flame-coloured and red, or between red and amber.

[38:72] For all the rays, seen at the same time, are far shining, and while they give no signs of their mutual combination, are incapable of being tested, so that it is impossible to discover the limits of the flame-coloured or of the emerald portion of the light, and at what point each originates before it appears as it does in glory.

[38:73] As then in the token we clearly distinguish the difference of the colours, and yet it is impossible for us to apprehend by our senses any interval between them; so in like manner conclude, I pray you, that you may reason concerning the divine dogmas; that the peculiar properties of the hypostases, like colours seen in the Iris, flash their brightness on each of the Persons Whom we believe to exist in the Holy Trinity; but that of the proper nature no difference can be conceived as existing between one and the other, the peculiar characteristics shining, in community of essence, upon each.

[38:74] Even in our example, the essence emitting the many-coloured radiance, and refracted by the sunbeam, was one essence; it is the colour of the phaenomenon which is multiform.

[38:75] My argument thus teaches us, even by the aid of the visible creation, not to feel distressed at points of doctrine whenever we meet with questions difficult of solution, and when at the thought of accepting what is proposed to us, our brains begin to reel.

[38:76] In regard to visible objects experience appears better than theories of causation, and so in matters transcending all knowledge, the apprehension of argument is inferior to the faith which teaches us at once the distinction in hypostasis and the conjunction in essence.

[38:77] Since then our discussion has included both what is common and what is distinctive in the Holy Trinity, the common is to be understood as referring to the essence; the hypostasis on the other hand is the several distinctive sign.

[38:78] 6.

[38:79] It may however be thought that the account here given of the hypostasis does not tally with the sense of the Apostle's words, where he says concerning the Lord that He is "the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person," for if we have taught hypostasis to be the conflux of the several properties; and if it is confessed that, as in the case of the Father something is contemplated as proper and peculiar, whereby He alone is known, so in the same way is it believed about the Only-begotten; how then does Scripture in this place ascribe the name of the hypostasis to the Father alone, and describes the Son as form of the hypostasis, and designated not by His own proper notes, but by those of the Father? For if the hypostasis is the sign of several existence, and the property of the Father is confined to the unbegotten being, and the Son is fashioned according to His Father's properties, then the term unbegotten can no longer be predicated exclusively of the Father, the existence of the Only-begotten being denoted by the distinctive note of the Father.

[38:80] 7.

[38:81] My opinion is, however, that in this passage the Apostle's argument is directed to a different end; and it is looking to this that he uses the terms "brightness of glory," and "express image of person".

[38:82] Whoever keeps this carefully in view will find nothing that clashes with what I have said, but that the argument is conducted in a special and peculiar sense.

[38:83] For the object of the apostolic argument is not the distinction of the hypostases from one another by means of the apparent notes; it is rather the apprehension of the natural, inseparable, and close relationship of the Son to the Father.

[38:84] He does not say "Who being the glory of the Father" (although in truth He is); he omits this as admitted, and then in the endeavour to teach that we must not think of one form of glory in the case of the Father and of another in that of the Son, He defines the glory of the Only-begotten as the brightness of the glory of the Father, and, by the use of the example of the light, causes the Son to be thought of in indissoluble association with the Father.

[38:85] For just as the brightness is emitted by the flame, and the brightness is not after the flame, but at one and the same moment the flame shines and the light beams brightly, so does the Apostle mean the Son to be thought of as deriving existence from the Father, and yet the Only-begotten not to be divided from the existence of the Father by any intervening extension in space, but the caused to be always conceived of together with the cause.

[38:86] Precisely in the same manner, as though by way of interpretation of the meaning of the preceding cause, and with the object of guiding us to the conception of the invisible by means of material examples, he speaks also of "express image of person".

[38:87] For as the body is wholly in form, and yet the definition of the body and the definition of the form are distinct, and no one wishing to give the definition of the one would be found in agreement with that of the other; and yet, even if in theory you separate the form from the body, nature does not admit of the distinction, and both are inseparably apprehended; just so the Apostle thinks that even if the doctrine of the faith represents the difference of the hypostases as unconfounded and distinct, he is bound by his language to set forth also the continuous and as it were concrete relation of the Only-begotten to the Father.

[38:88] And this he states, not as though the Only-begotten had not also a hypostatic being, but in that the union does not admit of anything intervening between the Son and the Father, with the result that he, who with his soul's eyes fixes his gaze earnestly on the express image of the Only-begotten, is made perceptive also of the hypostasis of the Father.

[38:89] Yet the proper quality contemplated in them is not subject to change, nor yet to commixture, in such wise as that we should attribute either an origin of generation to the Father or an origin without generation to the Son, but so that if we could compass the impossibility of detaching one from the other, that one might be apprehended severally and alone, for, since the mere name implies the Father, it is not possible that any one should even name the Son without apprehending the Father.

[38:90] 8.

[38:91] Since then, as says the Lord in the Gospels, he that hath seen the Son sees the Father also; on this account he says that the Only-begotten is the express image of His Father's person.

[38:92] That this may be made still plainer I will quote also other passages of the apostle in which he calls the Son "the image of the invisible God," and again "image of His goodness;" not because the image differs from the Archetype according to the definition of indivisibility and goodness, but that it may be shewn that it is the same as the prototype, even though it be different.

[38:93] For the idea of the image would be lost were it not to preserve throughout the plain and invariable likeness.

[38:94] He therefore that has perception of the beauty of the image is made perceptive of the Archetype.

[38:95] So he, who has, as it were mental apprehension of the form of the Son, prints the express image of the Father's hypostasis, beholding the latter in the former, not beholding in the reflection the unbegotten being of the Father (for thus there would be complete identity and no distinction), but gazing at the unbegotten beauty in the Begotten.

[38:96] Just as he who in a polished mirror beholds the reflection of the form as plain knowledge of the represented face, so he, who has knowledge of the Son, through his knowledge of the Son receives in his heart the express image of the Father's Person.

[38:97] For all things that are the Father's are beheld in the Son, and all things that are the Son's are the Father's; because the whole Son is in the Father and has all the Father in Himself.

[38:98] Thus the hypostasis of the Son becomes as it were form and face of the knowledge of the Father, and the hypostasis of the Father is known in the form of the Son, while the proper quality which is contemplated therein remains for the plain distinction of the hypostases.

[39:1] Letter XXXIX.

[39:2] Julian to Basil.

[39:3] The proverb says "You are not proclaiming war," and, let me add, out of the comedy, "O messenger of golden words".

[39:4] Come then; prove this in act, and hasten to me.

[39:5] You will come as friend to friend.

[39:6] Conspicuous and unremitting devotion to business seems, to those that treat it as of secondary importance, a heavy burden; yet the diligent are modest, as I persuade myself, sensible, and ready for any emergency.

[39:7] I allow myself relaxations so that even rest may be permitted to one who neglects nothing.

[39:8] Our mode of life is not marked by the court hypocrisy, of which I think you have had some experience, and in accordance with which compliments mean deadlier hatred than is felt to our worst foes; but, with becoming freedom, while we blame and rebuke where blame is due, we love with the love of the dearest friends.

[39:9] I may therefore, let me say, with all sincerity, both be diligent in relaxation and, when at work, not get worn out, and sleep secure; since when awake I do not wake more for myself, than, as is fit, for every one else.

[39:10] I am afraid this is rather silly and trifling, as I feel rather lazy, (I praise myself like Astydamas) but I am writing to prove to you that to have the pleasure of seeing you, wise man as you are, will be more likely to do me good than to cause any difficulty.

[39:11] Therefore, as I have said, lose no time: travel post haste.

[39:12] After you have paid me as long a visit as you like, you shall go on your journey, whithersoever you will, with my best wishes.

[40:1] Letter XL.

[40:2] Julian to Basil.

[40:3] While showing up to the present time the gentleness and benevolence which have been natural to me from my boyhood, I have reduced all who dwell beneath the sun to obedience.

[40:4] For lo! every tribe of barbarians to the shores of ocean has come to lay its gifts before my feet.

[40:5] So too the Sagadares who dwell beyond the Danube, wondrous with their bright tattooing, and hardly like human beings, so wild and strange are they, now grovel at my feet, and pledge themselves to obey all the behests my sovereignty imposes on them.

[40:6] I have a further object.

[40:7] I must as soon as possible march to Persia and rout and make a tributary of that Sapor, descendant of Darius.

[40:8] I mean too to devastate the country of the Indians and the Saracens until they all acknowledge my superiority and become my tributaries.

[40:9] You, however, profess a wisdom above and beyond these things; you call yourself clad with piety, but your clothing is really impudence and everywhere you slander me as one unworthy of the imperial dignity.

[40:10] Do you not know that I am the grandson of the illustrious Constantius? I know this of you, and yet I do not change the old feelings which I had to you, and you to me in the days when we were both young.

[40:11] But of my merciful will I command that a thousand pounds of gold be sent me from you, when I pass by Caesarea; for I am still on the march, and with all possible dispatch am hurrying to the Persian campaign.

[40:12] If you refuse I am prepared to destroy Caesarea, to overthrow the buildings that have long adorned it; to erect in their place temples and statues; and so to induce all men to submit to the Emperor of the Romans and not exalt themselves.

[40:13] Wherefore I charge you to send me without fail by the hands of some trusty messenger the stipulated gold, after duly counting and weighing it, and sealing it with your ring.

[40:14] In this way I may show mercy to you for your errors, if you acknowledge, however late, that no excuses will avail.

[40:15] I have learned to know, and to condemn, what once I read.

[41:1] Letter XLI.

[41:2] Basil to Julian.

[41:3] 1.

[41:4] The heroic deeds of your present splendour are small, and your grand attack against me, or rather against yourself, is paltry.

[41:5] When I think of you robed in purple, a crown on your dishonoured head, which, so long as true religion is absent, rather disgraces than graces your empire, I tremble.

[41:6] And you yourself who have risen to be so high and great, now that vile and honour-hating demons have brought you to this pass, have begun not only to exalt yourself above all human nature, but even to uplift yourself against God, and insult His Church, mother and nurse of all, by sending to me, most insignificant of men, orders to forward you a thousand pounds of gold.

[41:7] I am not so much astonished at the weight of the gold, although it is very serious; but it has made me shed bitter tears over your so rapid ruin.

[41:8] I bethink me how you and I have learned together the lessons of the best and holiest books.

[41:9] Each of us went through the sacred and God-inspired Scriptures.

[41:10] Then nothing was hid from you.

[41:11] Nowadays you have become lost to proper feeling, beleaguered as you are with pride.

[41:12] Your serene Highness did not find out for the first time yesterday that I do not live in the midst of superabundant wealth.

[41:13] To-day you have demanded a thousand pounds of gold of me.

[41:14] I hope your serenity will deign to spare me.

[41:15] My property amounts to so much, that I really shall not have enough to eat as much as I shall like to-day.

[41:16] Under my roof the art of cookery is dead.

[41:17] My servants' knife never touches blood.

[41:18] The most important viands, in which lies our abundance, are leaves of herbs with very coarse bread and sour wine, so that our senses are not dulled by gluttony, and do not indulge in excess.

[41:19] 2.

[41:20] Your excellent tribune Lausus, trusty minister of your orders, has also reported to me that a certain woman came as a suppliant to your serenity on the occasion of the death of her son by poison; that it has been judged by you that poisoners are not allowed to exist; if any there be, that they are to be destroyed, or, only those are reserved, who are to fight with beasts.

[41:21] And, this rightly decided by you, seems strange to me, for your efforts to cure the pain of great wounds by petty remedies are to the last degree ridiculous.

[41:22] After insulting God, it is useless for you to give heed to widows and orphans.

[41:23] The former is mad and dangerous; the latter the part of a merciful and kindly man.

[41:24] It is a serious thing for a private individual like myself to speak to an emperor; it will be more serious for you to speak to God.

[41:25] No one will appear to mediate between God and man.

[41:26] What you read you did not understand.

[41:27] If you had understood, you would not have condemned.

[42:1] Letter XLII.

[42:2] To Chilo, his disciple.

[42:3] 1.

[42:4] If, my true brother, you gladly suffer yourself to be advised by me as to what course of action you should pursue, specially in the points in which you have referred to me for advice, you will owe me your salvation.

[42:5] Many men have had the courage to enter upon the solitary life; but to live it out to the end is a task which perhaps has been achieved by few.

[42:6] The end is not necessarily involved in the intention; yet in the end is the guerdon of the toil.

[42:7] No advantage, therefore, accrues to men who fail to press on to the end of what they have in view and only adopt the solitary's life in its inception.

[42:8] Nay, they make their profession ridiculous, and are charged by outsiders with unmanliness and instability of purpose.

[42:9] Of these, moreover, the Lord says, who wishing to build a house "sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it? lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it," the passers-by "begin to mock him saying," this man laid a foundation "and was not able to finish".

[42:10] Let the start, then, mean that you heartily advance in virtue.

[42:11] The right noble athlete Paul, wishing us not to rest in easy security on so much of our life as may have been lived well in the past, but, every day to attain further progress, says "Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling".

[42:12] So truly stands the whole of human life, not contented with what has gone before and fed not so much on the past as on the future.

[42:13] For how is a man the better for having his belly filled yesterday, if his natural hunger fails to find its proper satisfaction in food to-day? In the same way the soul gains nothing by yesterday's virtue unless it be followed by the right conduct of to-day.

[42:14] For it is said "I shall judge thee as I shall find thee".

[42:15] 2.

[42:16] Vain then is the labour of the righteous man, and free from blame is the way of the sinner, if a change befall, and the former turn from the better to the worse, and the latter from the worse to the better.

[42:17] So we hear from Ezekiel teaching as it were in the name of the Lord, when he says, "if the righteous turneth away and committeth iniquity, I will not remember the righteousness which he committed before; in his sin he shall die," and so too about the sinner; if he turn away from his wickedness, and do that which is right, he shall live.

[42:18] Where were all the labours of God's servant Moses, when the gainsaying of one moment shut him out from entering into the promised land? What became of the companionship of Gehazi with Elissaeus, when he brought leprosy on himself by his covetousness? What availed all Solomon's vast wisdom, and his previous regard for God, when afterwards from his mad love of women he fell into idolatry? Not even the blessed David was blameless, when his thoughts went astray and he sinned against the wife of Uriah.

[42:19] One example were surely enough for keeping safe one who is living a godly life, the fall from the better to the worse of Judas, who, after being so long Christ's disciple, for a mean gain sold his Master and got a halter for himself.

[42:20] Learn then, brother, that it is not he who begins well who is perfect.

[42:21] It is he who ends well who is approved in God's sight.

[42:22] Give then no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids that you may be delivered "as a roe from the net and a bird from the snare".

[42:23] For, behold, you are passing through the midst of snares; you are treading on the top of a high wall whence a fall is perilous to the faller; wherefore do not straightway attempt extreme discipline; above all things beware of confidence in yourself, lest you fall from a height of discipline through want of training.

[42:24] It is better to advance a little at a time.

[42:25] Withdraw then by degrees from the pleasures of life, gradually destroying all your wonted habits, lest you bring on yourself a crowd of temptations by irritating all your passions at once.

[42:26] When you have mastered one passion, then begin to wage war against another, and in this manner you will in good time get the better of all.

[42:27] Indulgence, so far as the name goes, is one, but its practical workings are diverse.

[42:28] First then, brother, meet every temptation with patient endurance.

[42:29] And by what various temptations the faithful man is proved; by worldly loss, by accusations, by lies, by opposition, by calumny, by persecution! These and the like are the tests of the faithful.

[42:30] Further, be quiet, not rash in speech, not quarrelsome, not disputatious, not covetous of vain glory, not more anxious to get than to give knowledge, not a man of many words, but always more ready to learn than to teach.

[42:31] Do not trouble yourself about worldly life; from it no good can come to you.

[42:32] It is said, "That my mouth speak not the works of men".

[42:33] The man who is fond of talking about sinners' doings, soon rouses the desire for self indulgence; much better busy yourself about the lives of good men for so you will get some profit for yourself.

[42:34] Do not be anxious to go travelling about from village to village and house to house; rather avoid them as traps for souls.

[42:35] If any one, for true pity's sake, invite you with many pleas to enter his house, let him be told to follow the faith of the centurion, who, when Jesus was hastening to him to perform an act of healing, besought him not to do so in the words, "Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed," and when Jesus had said to him "Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee," his servant was healed from that hour.

[42:36] Learn then, brother, that it was the faith of the suppliant, not the presence of Christ, which delivered the sick man.

[42:37] So too now, if you pray, in whatever place you be, and the sick man believes that he will be aided by your prayers, all will fall out as he desires.

[42:38] 3.

[42:39] You will not love your kinsfolk more than the Lord.

[42:40] "He that loveth," He says, "father, or mother, or brother, more than me, is not worthy of me".

[42:41] What is the meaning of the Lord's commandment? "He that taketh not up his cross and followeth after me, cannot be my disciple?" If, together with Christ, you died to your kinsfolk according to the flesh, why do you wish to live with them again? If for your kinsfolk's sake you are building up again what you destroyed for Christ's sake, you make yourself a transgressor.

[42:42] Do not then for your kinsfolk's sake abandon your place: if you abandon your place, perhaps you will abandon your mode of life.

[42:43] Love not the crowd, nor the country, nor the town; love the desert, ever abiding by yourself with no wandering mind, regarding prayer and praise as your life's work.

[42:44] Never neglect reading, especially of the New Testament, because very frequently mischief comes of reading the Old; not because what is written is harmful, but because the minds of the injured are weak.

[42:45] All bread is nutritious, but it may be injurious to the sick.

[42:46] Just so all Scripture is God inspired and profitable, and there is nothing in it unclean: only to him who thinks it is unclean, to him it is unclean.

[42:47] "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good; abstain from every form of evil".

[42:48] "All things are lawful but all things are not expedient".

[42:49] Among all, with whom you come in contact, be in all things a giver of no offence, cheerful, "loving as a brother," pleasant, humble-minded, never missing the mark of hospitality through extravagance of meats, but always content with what is at hand.

[42:50] Take no more from any one than the daily necessaries of the solitary life.

[42:51] Above all things shun gold as the soul's foe, the father of sin and the agent of the devil.

[42:52] Do not expose yourself to the charge of covetousness on the pretence of ministering to the poor; but, if any one brings you money for the poor and you know of any who are in need, advise the owner himself to convey it to his needy brothers, lest haply your conscience may be defiled by the acceptance of money.

[42:53] 4.

[42:54] Shun pleasures; seek after continence; train your body to hard work; accustom your soul to trials.

[42:55] Regarding the dissolution of soul and body as release from every evil, await that enjoyment of everlasting good things in which all the saints have part.

[42:56] Ever, as it were, holding the balance against every suggestion of the devil throw in a holy thought, and, as the scale inclines do thou go with it.

[42:57] Above all when the evil thought starts up and says, "What is the good of your passing your life in this place? What do you gain by withdrawing yourself from the society of men? Do you not know that those, who are ordained by God to be bishops of God's churches, constantly associate with their fellows, and indefatigably attend spiritual gatherings at which those who are present derive very great advantage? There are to be enjoyed explanations of hard sayings, expositions of the teachings of the apostles, interpretations of the thoughts of the gospels, lessons in theology and the intercourse of spiritual brethren, who do great good to all they meet if only by the sight of their faces.

[42:58] You, however, who have decided to be a stranger to all these good things, are sitting here in a wild state like the beasts.

[42:59] You see round you a wide desert with scarcely a fellow creature in it, lack of all instruction, estrangement from your brothers, and your spirit inactive in carrying out the commandments of God".

[42:60] Now, when the evil thought rises against you, with all these ingenious pretexts and wishes to destroy you, oppose to it in pious reflection your own practical experience, and say, You tell me that the things in the world are good; the reason why I came here is because I judged myself unfit for the good things of the world.

[42:61] With the world's good things are mingled evil things, and the evil things distinctly have the upper hand.

[42:62] Once when I attended the spiritual assemblies I did with difficulty find one brother, who, so far as I could see, feared God, but he was a victim of the devil, and I heard from him amusing stories and tales made up to deceive those whom he met.

[42:63] After him I fell in with many thieves, plunderers, tyrants.

[42:64] I saw disgraceful drunkards; I saw the blood of the oppressed; I saw women's beauty, which tortured my chastity.

[42:65] From actual fornication I fled, but I defiled my virginity by the thoughts of my heart.

[42:66] I heard many discourses which were good for the soul, but I could not discover in the case of any one of the teachers that his life was worthy of his words.

[42:67] After this, again, I heard a great number of plays, which were made attractive by wanton songs.

[42:68] Then I heard a lyre sweetly played, the applause of tumblers, the talk of clowns, all kinds of jests and follies and all the noises of a crowd.

[42:69] I saw the tears of the robbed, the agony of the victims of tyranny, the shrieks of the tortured.

[42:70] I looked and lo, there was no spiritual assembly, but only a sea, wind-tossed and agitated, and trying to drown every one at once under its waves.

[42:71] Tell me, O evil thought, tell me, daemon of short lived pleasure and vain glory, what is the good of my seeing and hearing all these things, when I am powerless to succour any of those who are thus wronged; when I am allowed neither to defend the helpless nor correct the fallen; when I am perhaps doomed to destroy myself too.

[42:72] For just as a very little fresh water is blown away by a storm of wind and dust, in like manner the good deeds, that we think we do in this life, are overwhelmed by the multitude of evils.

[42:73] Pieces acted for men in this life are driven through joy and merriment, like stakes into their hearts, so that the brightness of their worship is be-dimmed.

[42:74] But the wails and lamentations of men wronged by their fellows are introduced to make a show of the patience of the poor.

[42:75] 5.

[42:76] What good then do I get except the loss of my soul? For this reason I migrate to the hills like a bird.

[42:77] "I am escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers".

[42:78] I am living, O evil thought, in the desert in which the Lord lived.

[42:79] Here is the oak of Mamre; here is the ladder going up to heaven, and the stronghold of the angels which Jacob saw; here is the wilderness in which the people purified received the law, and so came into the land of promise and saw God.

[42:80] Here is Mount Carmel where Elias sojourned and pleased God.

[42:81] Here is the plain whither Esdras withdrew, and at God's bidding uttered all the God inspired books.

[42:82] Here is the wilderness in which the blessed John ate locusts and preached repentance to men.

[42:83] Here is the Mount of Olives, whither Christ came and prayed, and taught us to pray.

[42:84] Here is Christ the lover of the wilderness, for He says "Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them".

[42:85] "Here is the strait and narrow way which leadeth unto life".

[42:86] Here are the teachers and prophets "wandering in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth".

[42:87] Here are apostles and evangelists and solitaries' life remote from cities.

[42:88] This I have embraced with all my heart, that I may win what has been promised to Christ's martyrs and all His other saints, and so I may truly say, "Because of the words of thy lips I have kept hard ways".

[42:89] I have heard of Abraham, God's friend, who obeyed the divine voice and went into the wilderness; of Isaac who submitted to authority; of Jacob, the patriarch, who left his home; of Joseph, the chaste, who was sold; of the three children, who learnt how to fast, and fought with the fire; of Daniel thrown twice into the lion's den; of Jeremiah speaking boldly, and thrown into a pit of mud; of Isaiah, who saw unspeakable things, cut asunder with a saw; of Israel led away captive; of John the rebuker of adultery, beheaded; of Christ's martyrs slain.

[42:90] But why say more? Here our Saviour Himself was crucified for our sakes that by His death He might give us life, and train and attract us all to endurance.

[42:91] To Him I press on, and to the Father and to the Holy Ghost.

[42:92] I strive to be found true, judging myself unworthy of this world's goods.

[42:93] And yet not I because of the world, but the world because of me.

[42:94] Think of all these things in your heart; follow them with zeal; fight, as you have been commanded, for the truth to the death.

[42:95] For Christ was made "obedient" even "unto death".

[42:96] The Apostle says, "Take heed lest there be in any of you an evil heart…in departing from the living God.

[42:97] But exhort one another…(and edify one another) while it is called to-day".

[42:98] To-day means the whole time of our life.

[42:99] Thus living, brother, you will save yourself, you will make me glad, and you will glorify God from everlasting to everlasting, Amen.

[43:1] Letter XLIII.

[43:2] Admonition to the Young.

[43:3] O faithful man of solitary life, and practiser of true religion, learn the lessons of the evangelic conversation, of mastery over the body, of a meek spirit, of purity of mind, of destruction of pride.

[43:4] Pressed into the service, add to your gifts, for the Lord's sake; robbed, never go to law; hated, love; persecuted, endure; slandered, entreat.

[43:5] Be dead to sin; be crucified to God.

[43:6] Cast all your care upon the Lord, that you may be found where are tens of thousands of angels, assemblies of the first-born, the thrones of prophets, sceptres of patriarchs, crowns of martyrs, praises of righteous men.

[43:7] Earnestly desire to be numbered with those righteous men in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[43:8] To Him be glory for ever, Amen.

[44:1] Letter XLIV.

[44:2] To a lapsed Monk.

[44:3] 1.

[44:4] I do not wish you joy, for there is no joy for the wicked.

[44:5] Even now I cannot believe it; my heart cannot conceive iniquity so great as the crime which you have committed; if, that is, the truth really is what is generally understood.

[44:6] I am at a loss to think how wisdom so deep can have been made to disappear; how such exact discipline can have been undone; whence blindness so profound can have been shed round you; how with utter inconsiderateness you have wrought such destruction of souls.

[44:7] If this be true, you have given over your own soul to the pit, and have slackened the earnestness of all who have heard of your impiety.

[44:8] You have set at nought the faith; you have missed the glorious fight.

[44:9] I grieve over you.

[44:10] What cleric does not lament as he hears? What ecclesiastic does not beat the breast? What layman is not downcast? What ascetic is not sad? Haply, even the sun has grown dark at your fall, and the powers of heaven have been shaken at your destruction.

[44:11] Even senseless stones have shed tears at your madness; even your enemies have wept at the greatness of your iniquity.

[44:12] Oh hardness of heart! Oh cruelty! You did not fear God; you did not reverence men; you cared nothing for your friends; you made shipwreck of all at once; at once you were stripped of all.

[44:13] Once more I grieve over you, unhappy man.

[44:14] You were proclaiming to all the power of the kingdom, and you fell from it.

[44:15] You were making all stand in fear of your teaching, and there was no fear of God before your eyes.

[44:16] You were preaching purity, and you are found polluted.

[44:17] You were priding yourself on your poverty, and you are convicted of covetousness; you were demonstrating and explaining the chastisement of God, and you yourself brought chastisement on your own head.

[44:18] How am I to lament you, how grieve for you? How is Lucifer that was rising in the morning fallen and dashed on the ground? Both the ears of every hearer will tingle.

[44:19] How is the Nazarite, brighter than gold, become dark above pitch? How has the glorious son of Sion become an unprofitable vessel! Of him, whose memory of the sacred Scriptures was in all men's mouths, the memory to-day has perished with the sound.

[44:20] The man of quick intelligence has quickly perished.

[44:21] The man of manifold wit has wrought manifold iniquity.

[44:22] All who profited by your teaching have been injured by your fall.

[44:23] All who came to listen to your conversation have stopped their ears at your fall.

[44:24] I, sorrowful and downcast, weakened in every way, eating ashes for bread and with sackcloth on my wound, am thus recounting your praises; or rather, with none to comfort and none to cure, am making an inscription for a tomb.

[44:25] For comfort is hid from my eyes.

[44:26] I have no salve, no oil, no bandage to put on.

[44:27] My wound is sore, how shall I be healed?  2.

[44:28] If you have any hope of salvation; if you have the least thought of God, or any desire for good things to come; if you have any fear of the chastisements reserved for the impenitent, awake without delay, lift up your eyes to heaven, come to your senses, cease from your wickedness, shake off the stupor that enwraps you, make a stand against the foe who has struck you down.

[44:29] Make an effort to rise from the ground.

[44:30] Remember the good Shepherd who will follow and rescue you.

[44:31] Though it be but two legs or a lobe of an ear, spring back from the beast that has wounded you.

[44:32] Remember the mercies of God and how He cures with oil and wine.

[44:33] Do not despair of salvation.

[44:34] Recall your recollection of how it is written in the Scriptures that he who is falling rises and he who turns away returns; the wounded is healed, the prey of beasts escapes; he who owns his sin is not rejected.

[44:35] The Lord willeth not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn and live.

[44:36] Do not despise, like the wicked in the pit of evil.

[44:37] There is a time of endurance, a time of long suffering, a time of healing, a time of correction.

[44:38] Have you stumbled? Arise.

[44:39] Have you sinned? Cease.

[44:40] Do not stand in the way of sinners, but spring away.

[44:41] When you are converted and groan you shall be saved.

[44:42] Out of labour comes health, out of sweat salvation.

[44:43] Beware lest, from your wish to keep certain obligations, you break the obligations to God which you professed before many witnesses.

[44:44] Pray do not hesitate to come to me for any earthly considerations.

[44:45] When I have recovered my dead I shall lament, I shall tend him, I will weep "because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people".

[44:46] All are ready to welcome you, all will share your efforts.

[44:47] Do not sink back.

[44:48] Remember the days of old.

[44:49] There is salvation; there is amendment.

[44:50] Be of good cheer; do not despair.

[44:51] It is not a law condemning to death without pity, but mercy remitting punishment and awaiting improvement.

[44:52] The doors are not yet shut; the bridegroom hears; sin is not the master.

[44:53] Make another effort, do not hesitate, have pity on yourself and on all of us in Jesus Christ our Lord, to Whom be glory and might now and for ever and ever, Amen.

[45:1] Letter XLV.

[45:2] To a lapsed Monk.

[45:3] 1.

[45:4] I am doubly alarmed to the very bottom of my heart, and you are the cause.

[45:5] I am either the victim of some unkindly prepossession, and so am driven to make an unbrotherly charge; or, with every wish to feel for you, and to deal gently with your troubles, I am forced to take a different and an unfriendly attitude.

[45:6] Wherefore, even as I take my pen to write, I have nerved my unwilling hand by reflection; but my face, downcast as it is, because of my sorrow over you, I have had no power to change.

[45:7] I am so covered with shame, for your sake, that my lips are turned to mourning and my mouth straightway falls.

[45:8] Ah me! What am I to write? What shall I think in my perplexity?  If I call to mind your former empty mode of life, when you were rolling in riches and had abundance of petty mundane reputation, I shudder; then you were followed by a mob of flatterers, and had the short enjoyment of luxury, with obvious peril and unfair gain; on the one hand, fear of the magistrates scattered your care for your salvation, on the other the agitations of public affairs disturbed your home, and the continuance of troubles directed your mind to Him Who is able to help you.

[45:9] Then, little by little, you took to seeking for the Saviour, Who brings you fears for your good, Who delivers you and protects you, though you mocked Him in your security.

[45:10] Then you began to train yourself for a change to a worthy life, treating all your perilous property as mere dung, and abandoning the care of your household and the society of your wife.

[45:11] All abroad like a stranger and a vagabond, wandering through town and country, you betook yourself to Jerusalem.

[45:12] There I myself lived with you, and, for the toil of your ascetic discipline, called you blessed, when fasting for weeks you continued in contemplation before God, shunning the society of your fellows, like a routed runaway.

[45:13] Then you arranged for yourself a quiet and solitary life, and refused all the disquiets of society.

[45:14] You pricked your body with rough sackcloth; you tightened a hard belt round your loins; you bravely put wearing pressure on your bones; you made your sides hang loose from front to back, and all hollow with fasting; you would wear no soft bandage, and drawing in your stomach, like a gourd, made it adhere to the parts about your kidneys.

[45:15] You emptied out all fat from your flesh; all the channels below your belly you dried up; your belly itself you folded up for want of food; your ribs, like the caves of a house, you made to overshadow all the parts about your middle, and, with all your body contracted, you spent the long hours of the night in pouring out confession to God, and made your beard wet with channels of tears.

[45:16] Why particularize? Remember how many mouths of saints you saluted with a kiss, how many bodies you embraced, how many held your hands as undefiled, how many servants God, as though in worship, ran and clasped you by the knees.

[45:17] 2.

[45:18] And what is the end of all this? My ears are wounded by a charge of adultery, flying swifter than an arrow, and piercing my heart with a sharper sting.

[45:19] What crafty wiliness of wizard has driven you into so deadly a trap? What many-meshed devil's nets have entangled you and disabled all the powers of your virtue? What has become of the story of your labours? Or must we disbelieve them? How can we avoid giving credit to what has long been hid when we see what is plain? What shall we say of your having by tremendous oaths bound souls which fled for refuge to God, when what is more than yea and nay is carefully attributed to the devil? You have made yourself security for fatal perjury; and, by setting the ascetic character at nought, you have cast blame even upon the Apostles and the very Lord Himself.

[45:20] You have shamed the boast of purity.

[45:21] You have disgraced the promise of chastity; we have been made a tragedy of captives, and our story is made a play of before Jews and Greeks.

[45:22] You have made a split in the solitaries' spirit, driving those of exacter discipline into fear and cowardice, while they still wonder at the power of the devil, and seducing the careless into imitation of your incontinence.

[45:23] So far as you have been able, you have destroyed the boast of Christ, Who said, "Be of good cheer I have overcome the world," and its Prince.

[45:24] You have mixed for your country a bowl of ill repute.

[45:25] Verily you have proved the truth of the proverb, "Like a hart stricken through the liver".

[45:26] But what now? The tower of strength has not fallen, my brother.

[45:27] The remedies of correction are not mocked; the city of refuge is not shut.

[45:28] Do not abide in the depths of evil.

[45:29] Do not deliver yourself to the slayer of souls.

[45:30] The Lord knows how to set up them that are dashed down.

[45:31] Do not try to flee afar off, but hasten to me.

[45:32] Resume once more the labours of your youth, and by a fresh course of good deeds destroy the indulgence that creeps foully along the ground.

[45:33] Look to the end, that has come so near to our life.

[45:34] See how now the sons of Jews and Greeks are being driven to the worship of God, and do not altogether deny the Saviour of the World.

[45:35] Never let that most awful sentence apply to you, "Depart from me, I never knew you".

[46:1] Letter XLVI.

[46:2] To a fallen virgin.

[46:3] 1.

[46:4] Now is the time to quote the words of the prophet and to say, "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people".

[46:5] Though they are wrapped in profound silence and lie stunned by their misfortune, robbed of all sense of feeling by the fatal blow, I at all events must not let such a fall go unlamented.

[46:6] If, to Jeremiah, it seemed that those whose bodies had been wounded in war, were worthy of innumerable lamentations, what shall be said of such a disaster of souls? "My slain men," it is said, "are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle".

[46:7] But I am bewailing the sting of the real death, the grievousness of sin and the fiery darts of the wicked one, which have savagely set on fire souls as well as bodies.

[46:8] Truly God's laws would groan aloud on seeing so great a pollution on the earth.

[46:9] They have pronounced their prohibition of old "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife"; and through the holy gospels they say that "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already with her in his heart".

[46:10] Now they see the bride of the Lord herself, whose head is Christ, boldly committing adultery.

[46:11] So too would groan the companies of the Saints.

[46:12] Phinehas, the zealous, because he can now no more take his spear into his hands and avenge the outrage on the bodies; and John the Baptist, because he cannot quit the realms above, as in his life he left the wilderness, to hasten to convict iniquity, and if he must suffer for the deed, rather lose his head than his freedom to speak.

[46:13] But, peradventure, like the blessed Abel, he too though dead yet speaks to us, and now exclaims, more loudly than John of old concerning Herodias, "It is not lawful for thee to have her".

[46:14] For even if the body of John in obedience to the law of nature has received the sentence of God, and his tongue is silent, yet "the word of God is not bound".

[46:15] John, when he saw the wedlock of a fellow servant set at nought, was bold to rebuke even to the death: how would he feel on seeing such an outrage wreaked on the marriage chamber of the Lord?  2.

[46:16] You have flung away the yoke of that divine union; you have fled from the undefiled chamber of the true King; you have shamefully fallen into this disgraceful and impious corruption; and now that you cannot avoid this painful charge, and have no means or device to conceal your trouble, you rush into insolence.

[46:17] The wicked man after falling into a pit of iniquity always begins to despise, and you are denying your actual covenant with the true bridegroom; you say that you are not a virgin, and made no promise, although you have undertaken and publicly professed many pledges of virginity.

[46:18] Remember the good profession which you witnessed before God, angels, and men.

[46:19] Remember the hallowed intercourse, the sacred company of virgins, the assembly of the Lord, the Church of the holy.

[46:20] Remember your grandmother, grown old in Christ, still youthful and vigorous in virtue; and your mother vying with her in the Lord, and striving to break with ordinary life in strange and unwonted toils; remember your sister, who copies their doings, nay, endeavours to surpass them, and goes beyond the good deeds of her fathers in her virgin graces, and earnestly challenges by word and deed you her sister, as she thinks, to like efforts, while she earnestly prays that your virginity be preserved.

[46:21] All these call to mind, and your holy service of God with them, your life spiritual, though in the flesh; your conversation heavenly, though on earth.

[46:22] Remember days of calm, nights lighted up, spiritual songs, sweet music of psalms, saintly prayers, a bed pure and undefiled, procession of virgins, and moderate fare.

[46:23] What has become of your grave appearance, your gracious demeanour, your plain dress, meet for a virgin, the beautiful blush of modesty, the comely and bright pallor due to temperance and vigils, shining fairer than any brilliance of complexion? How often have you not prayed, perhaps with tears, that you might preserve your virginity without spot! How often have you not written to the holy men, imploring them to offer up prayers in your behalf, not that it should be your lot to marry, still less to be involved in this shameful corruption, but that you should not fall away from the Lord Jesus? How often have you received gifts from the Bridegroom? Why enumerate the honours given you for His sake by them that are His? Why tell of your fellowship with virgins, your progress with them, your being greeted by them with praises on account of virginity, eulogies of virgins, letters written as to a virgin? Now, nevertheless, at a little blast from the spirit of the air, "that now worketh in the children of disobedience," you have abjured all these; you have changed the honourable treasure, worth fighting for at all costs, for short-lived indulgence which does for the moment gratify the appetite; one day you will find it more bitter than gall.

[46:24] 3.

[46:25] Who would not grieve over such things and say, "How is the faithful city become an harlot?" How would not the Lord Himself say to some of those who are now walking in the spirit of Jeremiah, "Hast thou seen what the virgin of Israel has done to me?" I betrothed her to me in trust, in purity, in righteousness, in judgment, in pity, and in mercy; as I promised her through Hosea the prophet.

[46:26] But she loved strangers, and while I, her husband, was yet alive, she is called adulteress, and is not afraid to belong to another husband.

[46:27] What then says the conductor of the bride, the divine and blessed Paul, both that one of old, and the later one of to-day under whose mediation and instruction you left your father's house and were united to the Lord? Might not either, in sorrow for such a trouble, say, "The thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me".

[46:28] "I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ".

[46:29] I was indeed ever afraid "lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your mind should be corrupted;" wherefore by countless counter-charms I strove to control the agitation of your senses, and by countless safeguards to preserve the bride of the Lord.

[46:30] So I continually set forth the life of the unmarried maid, and described how "the unmarried" alone "careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit".

[46:31] I used to describe the high dignity of virginity, and, addressing you as a temple of God, used as it were to give wings to your zeal as I strove to lift you to Jesus.

[46:32] Yet through fear of evil I helped you not to fall by the words "if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy".

[46:33] So by my prayers I tried to make you more secure, if by any means "your body, soul, and spirit might be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ".

[46:34] Yet all my toil on your behalf has been in vain.

[46:35] Bitter to me has been the end of those sweet labours.

[46:36] Now I needs must groan again at that over which I ought to have rejoiced.

[46:37] You have been deceived by the serpent more bitterly than Eve; and not only your mind but also your body has been defiled.

[46:38] Even that last horror has come to pass which I shrink from saying, and yet cannot leave unsaid, for it is as a burning and blazing fire in my bones, and I am undone and cannot endure.

[46:39] You have taken the members of Christ and made them the members of a harlot.

[46:40] This is an evil with which no other can be matched.

[46:41] This outrage in life is new.

[46:42] "For pass over the Isles of Chittim and see; and send unto Chedar and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.

[46:43] Hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods".

[46:44] But the virgin has changed her glory, and her glory is in her shame.

[46:45] The heavens are astonished at this, and the earth is horribly afraid, saith the Lord, for the virgin has committed two evils; she has forsaken Me, the true and holy Bridegroom of holy souls, and has betaken herself to an impious and lawless destroyer of body and soul alike.

[46:46] She has revolted from God, her Saviour, and yielded her members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity.

[46:47] She forgot me and went after her lover from whom she will get no good.

[46:48] 4.

[46:49] It were better for him that a mill-stone had been hanged about his neck, and that he had been cast into the sea, than that he should have offended the virgin of the Lord.

[46:50] What slave ever reached such a pitch of mad audacity as to fling himself upon his master's bed? What robber ever attained such a height of folly as to lay hands upon the very offerings of God, not dead vessels, but bodies living and enshrining a soul made after the image of God? Who was ever known to have the hardihood, in the heart of a city and at high noon, to mark figures of filthy swine upon a royal statue? He who has set at naught a marriage of man, with no mercy shewn him, in the presence of two or three witnesses, dies.

[46:51] Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and defiled His pledged bride and done despite unto the spirit of virginity? But the woman, he urges, consented, and I did no violence to her against her will.

[46:52] So, that unchaste lady of Egypt raged with love for comely Joseph, but the chaste youth's virtue was not overcome by the frenzy of the wicked woman, and, even when she laid her hand upon him, he was not forced into iniquity.

[46:53] But still, he urges, this was no new thing in her case; she was no longer a maid; if I had been unwilling, she would have been corrupted by some one else.

[46:54] Yes; and it is written, the Son of Man was ordained to be betrayed, but woe unto that man by whom He was betrayed.

[46:55] It must needs be that offences come, but woe to that man by whom they come.

[46:56] 5.

[46:57] In such a state of things as this, "Shall they fall and not arise? Shall he turn away and not return?" Why did the virgin turn shamefully away, though she had heard Christ her bridegroom saying through the mouth of Jeremiah, "And I said, after she had done all these things (committed all these fornications, LXX.

[46:58] ), turn thou unto me, but she returned not?" "Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?" You might indeed find many remedies for evil in Scripture, many medicines to save from destruction and lead to health; the mysteries of death and resurrection, the sentences of terrible judgment and everlasting punishment; the doctrines of repentance and of remission of sins; all the countless illustrations of conversion, the piece of money, the sheep, the son who wasted his substance with harlots, who was lost and was found, who was dead and alive again.

[46:59] Let us not use these remedies for ill; by these means let us heal our soul.

[46:60] Bethink you of your last day, for you will surely not, unlike all other women, live for ever.

[46:61] The distress, the gasping for breath, the hour of death, the imminent sentence of God, the angels hastening on their way, the soul fearfully dismayed, and lashed to agony by the consciousness of sin, turning itself piteously to things of this life and to the inevitable necessity of that long life to be lived elsewhere.

[46:62] Picture to me, as it rises in your imagination, the conclusion of all human life, when the Son of God shall come in His glory with His angels, "For he shall come and shall not keep silence;" when He shall come to judge the quick and dead, to render to every one according to his work; when that terrible trumpet with its mighty voice shall wake those that have slept through the ages, and they that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation.

[46:63] Remember the vision of Daniel, and how he brings the judgment before us: "I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool;…and His wheels as burning fire.

[46:64] A fiery stream issued and came forth before Him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened," clearly disclosing in the hearing of all, angels and men, things good and evil, things done openly and in secret, deeds, words, and thoughts all at once.

[46:65] What then must those men be who have lived wicked lives? Where then shall that soul hide which in the sight of all these spectators shall suddenly be revealed in its fulness of shame? With what kind of body shall it sustain those endless and unbearable pangs in the place of fire unquenched, and of the worm that perishes and never dies, and of depth of Hades, dark and horrible; bitter wailings, loud lamenting, weeping and gnashing of teeth and anguish without end? From all these woes there is no release after death; no device, no means of coming forth from the chastisement of pain.

[46:66] 6.

[46:67] We can escape now.

[46:68] While we can, let us lift ourselves from the fall: let us never despair of ourselves, if only we depart from evil.

[46:69] Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.

[46:70] "O come, let us worship and fall down; let us weep before Him".

[46:71] The Word Who invited us to repentance calls aloud, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest".

[46:72] There is, then, a way of salvation, if we will.

[46:73] "Death in his might has swallowed up, but again the Lord hath wiped away tears from off all faces" of them that repent.

[46:74] The Lord is faithful in all His words.

[46:75] He does not lie when He says, "Though your sins be scarlet they shall be as white as snow.

[46:76] Though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool".

[46:77] The great Physician of souls, Who is the ready liberator, not of you alone, but of all who are enslaved by sin, is ready to heal your sickness.

[46:78] From Him come the words, it was His sweet and saving lips that said, "They that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick.

[46:79] …I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance".

[46:80] What excuse have you, what excuse has any one, when He speaks thus? The Lord wishes to cleanse you from the trouble of your sickness and to show you light after darkness.

[46:81] The good Shepherd, Who left them that had not wandered away, is seeking after you.

[46:82] If you give yourself to Him He will not hold back.

[46:83] He, in His love, will not disdain even to carry you on His own shoulders, rejoicing that He has found His sheep which was lost.

[46:84] The Father stands and awaits your return from your wandering.

[46:85] Only come back, and while you are yet afar off, He will run and fall upon your neck, and, now that you are cleansed by repentance, will enwrap you in embraces of love.

[46:86] He will clothe with the chief robe the soul that has put off the old man with all his works; He will put a ring on hands that have washed off the blood of death, and will put shoes on feet that have turned from the evil way to the path of the Gospel of peace.

[46:87] He will announce the day of joy and gladness to them that are His own, both angels and men, and will celebrate your salvation far and wide.

[46:88] For "verily I say unto you," says He, "there is joy in heaven before God over one sinner that repenteth".

[46:89] If any of those who think they stand find fault because of your quick reception, the good Father will Himself make answer for you in the words, "It was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this" my daughter "was dead and is alive again, was lost and is found".

[47:1] Letter XLVII.

[47:2] To Gregory".

[47:3] Who will give me wings like a dove? Or how can my old age be so renewed that I can travel to your affection, satisfy my deep longing to see you, tell you all the troubles of my soul, and get from you some comfort in my affliction? For when the blessed bishop Eusebius fell asleep, we were under no small alarm lest plotters against the Church of our Metropolis, wishful to fill it with their heretical tares, should seize the present opportunity, root out by their wicked teaching the true faith sown by much labour in men's souls, and destroy its unity.

[47:4] This has been the result of their action in many churches.

[47:5] When however I received the letters of the clergy exhorting me not to let their needs be overlooked at such a crisis, as I ranged my eyes in all directions I bethought me of your loving spirit, your right faith, and your unceasing zeal on behalf of the churches of God.

[47:6] I have therefore sent the well beloved Eustathius, the deacon, to invite your reverence, and implore you to add this one more to all your labours on behalf of the Church.

[47:7] I entreat you also to refresh my old age by a sight of you; and to maintain for the true Church its famous orthodoxy, by uniting with me, if I may be deemed worthy of uniting with you, in the good work, to give it a shepherd in accordance with the will of the Lord, able to guide His people aright.

[47:8] I have before my eyes a man not unknown even to yourself.

[47:9] If only we be found worthy to secure him, I am sure that we shall acquire a confident access to God and confer a very great benefit on the people who have invoked our aid.

[47:10] Now once again, aye, many times I call on you, all hesitation put aside, to come to meet me, and to set out before the difficulties of winter intervene.

[48:1] Letter XLVIII.

[48:2] To Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata.

[48:3] I have had considerable difficulty in finding a messenger to convey a letter to your reverence, for our men are so afraid of the winter that they can hardly bear even to put their heads outside their houses.

[48:4] We have suffered from such a very heavy fall of snow that we have been buried, houses and all, beneath it, and now for two months have been living in dens and caves.

[48:5] You know the Cappadocian character and how hard it is to get us to move.

[48:6] Forgive me then for not writing sooner and bringing to the knowledge of your excellency the latest news from Antioch.

[48:7] To tell you all this now, when it is probable that you learnt it long ago, is stale and uninteresting.

[48:8] But as I do not reckon it any trouble to tell you even what you know, I have sent you the letters conveyed by the reader.

[48:9] On this point I shall say no more.

[48:10] Constantinople has now for some time had Demophilus, as the bearers of this letter will themselves tell you, and as has doubtless been reported to your holiness.

[48:11] From all who come to us from that city there is unanimously reported about him a certain counterfeit of orthodoxy and sound religion, to such an extent that even the divided portions of the city have been brought to agreement, and some of the neighbouring bishops have accepted the reconciliation.

[48:12] Our men here have not turned out better than I expected.

[48:13] They came directly you were gone, said and did many painful things, and at last went home again, after making their separation from me wider.

[48:14] Whether anything better will happen in the future, and whether they will give up their evil ways, is unknown to all but God.

[48:15] So much for our present condition.

[48:16] The rest of the Church, by God's grace, stands sound, and prays that in the spring we may have you with us again, and be renewed by your good counsel.

[48:17] My health is no better than it ever is.

[49:1] Letter XLIX.

[49:2] To Arcadius the Bishop.

[49:3] I thanked the Holy God when I read your letter, most pious brother.

[49:4] I pray that I may not be unworthy of the expectations you have formed of me, and that you will enjoy a full reward for the honour which you pay me in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[49:5] I was exceedingly pleased to hear that you have been occupied in a matter eminently becoming a Christian, have raised a house to the glory of God, and have in practical earnest loved, as it is written, "the beauty of the house of the Lord," and have so provided for yourself that heavenly mansion which is prepared in His rest for them that love the Lord.

[49:6] If I am able to find any relics of martyrs, I pray that I may take part in your earnest endeavour.

[49:7] If "the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance," I shall without doubt have a share in the good fame which the Holy One will give you.

[50:1] Letter L.

[50:2] To Bishop Innocentius.

[50:3] Whom, indeed, could it better befit to encourage the timid, and rouse the slumbering, than you, my godly lord, who have shewn your general excellence in this, too, that you have consented to come down among us, your lowly inferiors, like a true disciple of Him Who said, "I am among you," not as a fellow guest, but "as he that serveth".

[50:4] For you have condescended to minister to us your spiritual gladness, to refresh our souls by your honoured letter, and, as it were, to fling the arms of your greatness round the infancy of children.

[50:5] We, therefore, implore your good soul to pray, that we may be worthy to receive aid from the great, such as yourself, and to have a mouth and wisdom wherewith to chime in with the strain of all, who like you are led by the Holy Spirit.

[50:6] Of Him I hear that you are a friend and true worshipper, and I am deeply thankful for your strong and unshaken love to God.

[50:7] I pray that my lot may be found with the true worshippers, among whom we are sure your excellency is to be ranked, as well as that great and true bishop who has filled all the world with his wonderful work.

[51:1] Letter LI.

[51:2] To Bishop Bosporius.

[51:3] How do you think my heart was pained at hearing of the slanders heaped on me by some of those that feel no fear of the Judge, who "shall destroy them that speak leasing"? I spent nearly the whole night sleepless, thinking of your words of love; so did grief lay hold upon my heart of hearts.

[51:4] For verily, in the words of Solomon, slander humbleth a man.

[51:5] And no man is so void of feeling as not to be touched at heart, and bowed down to the ground, if he falls in with lips prone to lying.

[51:6] But we must needs put up with all things and endure all things, after committing our vindication to the Lord.

[51:7] He will not despise us; for "he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker".

[51:8] They, however, who have patched up this new tragedy of blasphemy seem to have lost all belief in the Lord, Who has declared that we must give account at the day of judgment even for an idle word.

[51:9] And I, tell me, I anathematized the right blessed Dianius? For this is what they have said against me.

[51:10] Where? When? In whose presence? On what pretext? In mere spoken words, or in writing? Following others, or myself the author and originator of the deed? Alas for the impudence of men who make no difficulty at saying anything! Alas for their contempt of the judgment of God! Unless, indeed, they add this further to their fiction, that they make me out to have been once upon a time so far out of my mind as not to know what I was saying.

[51:11] For so long as I have been in my senses I know that I never did anything of the kind, or had the least wish to do so.

[51:12] What I am, indeed, conscious of is this; that from my earliest childhood I was brought up in love for him, thought as I gazed at him how venerable he looked, how dignified, how truly reverend.

[51:13] Then when I grew older I began to know him by the good qualities of his soul, and took delight in his society, gradually learning to perceive the simplicity, nobility, and liberality of his character, and all his most distinctive qualities, his gentleness of soul, his mingled magnanimity and meekness, the seemliness of his conduct, his control of temper, the beaming cheerfulness and affability which he combined with majesty of demeanour.

[51:14] From all this I counted him among men most illustrious for high character.

[51:15] However, towards the close of his life (I will not conceal the truth) I, together with many of them that in our country feared the Lord, sorrowed over him with sorrow unendurable, because he signed the creed brought from Constantinople by George.

[51:16] Afterwards, full of kindness and gentleness as he was, and willing out of the fulness of his fatherly heart to give satisfaction to everyone, when he had already fallen sick of the disease of which he died, he sent for me, and, calling the Lord to witness, said that in the simplicity of his heart he had agreed to the document sent from Constantinople, but had had no idea of rejecting the creed put forth by the holy Fathers at Nicaea, nor had had any other disposition of heart than from the beginning he had always had.

[51:17] He prayed, moreover, that he might not be cut off from the lot of those blessed three hundred and eighteen bishops who had announced the pious decree to the world.

[51:18] In consequence of this satisfactory statement I dismissed all anxiety and doubt, and, as you are aware, communicated with him, and gave over grieving.

[51:19] Such have been my relations with Dianius.

[51:20] If anyone avers that he is privy to any vile slander on my part against Dianius, do not let him buzz it slave-wise in a corner; let him come boldly out and convict me in the light of day.

[52:1] Letter LII.

[52:2] To the Canonicae.

[52:3] 1.

[52:4] I have been very much distressed by a painful report which reached my ears; but I have been equally delighted by my brother, beloved of God, bishop Bosporius, who has brought a more satisfactory account of you.

[52:5] He avers by God's grace that all those stories spread abroad about you are inventions of men who are not exactly informed as to the truth about you.

[52:6] He added, moreover, that he found among you impious calumnies about me, of a kind likely to be uttered by those who do not expect to have to give the Judge in the day of His righteous retribution an account of even an idle word.

[52:7] I thank God, then, both because I am cured of my damaging opinion of you, an opinion which I have derived from the calumnies of men, and because I have heard of your abandonment of those baseless notions about me, on hearing the assurances of my brother.

[52:8] He, in all that he has said as coming from himself, has also completely expressed my own feeling.

[52:9] For in us both there is one mind about the faith, as being heirs of the same Fathers who once at Nicaea promulgated their great decree concerning the faith.

[52:10] Of this, some portions are universally accepted without cavil, but the homoousion, ill received in certain quarters, is still rejected by some.

[52:11] These objectors we may very properly blame, and yet on the contrary deem them deserving of pardon.

[52:12] To refuse to follow the Fathers, not holding their declaration of more authority than one's own opinion, is conduct worthy of blame, as being brimful of self-sufficiency.

[52:13] On the other hand the fact that they view with suspicion a phrase which is misrepresented by an opposite party does seem to a small extent to relieve them from blame.

[52:14] Moreover, as a matter of fact, the members of the synods which met to discuss the case of Paul of Samosata did find fault with the term as an unfortunate one.

[52:15] For they maintained that the homoousion set forth the idea both of essence and of what is derived from it, so that the essence, when divided, confers the title of co-essential on the parts into which it is divided.

[52:16] This explanation has some reason in the case of bronze and coins made therefrom, but in the case of God the Father and God the Son there is no question of substance anterior or even underlying both; the mere thought and utterance of such a thing is the last extravagance of impiety.

[52:17] What can be conceived of as anterior to the Unbegotten? By this blasphemy faith in the Father and the Son is destroyed, for things, constituted out of one, have to one another the relation of brothers.

[52:18] 2.

[52:19] Because even at that time there were men who asserted the Son to have been brought into being out of the non-existent, the term homoousion was adopted, to extirpate this impiety.

[52:20] For the conjunction of the Son with the Father is without time and without interval.

[52:21] The preceding words shew this to have been the intended meaning.

[52:22] For after saying that the Son was light of light, and begotten of the substance of the Father, but was not made, they went on to add the homoousion, thereby showing that whatever proportion of light any one would attribute in the case of the Father will obtain also in that of the Son.

[52:23] For very light in relation to very light, according to the actual sense of light, will have no variation.

[52:24] Since then the Father is light without beginning, and the Son begotten light, but each of Them light and light; they rightly said "of one substance," in order to set forth the equal dignity of the nature.

[52:25] Things, that have a relation of brotherhood, are not, as some persons have supposed, of one substance; but when both the cause and that which derives its natural existence from the cause are of the same nature, then they are called "of one substance".

[52:26] 3.

[52:27] This term also corrects the error of Sabellius, for it removes the idea of the identity of the hypostases, and introduces in perfection the idea of the Persons.

[52:28] For nothing can be of one substance with itself, but one thing is of one substance with another.

[52:29] The word has therefore an excellent and orthodox use, defining as it does both the proper character of the hypostases, and setting forth the invariability of the nature.

[52:30] And when we are taught that the Son is of the substance of the Father, begotten and not made, let us not fall into the material sense of the relations.

[52:31] For the substance was not separated from the Father and bestowed on the Son; neither did the substance engender by fluxion, nor yet by shooting forth as plants their fruits.

[52:32] The mode of the divine begetting is ineffable and inconceivable by human thought.

[52:33] It is indeed characteristic of poor and carnal intelligence to compare the things that are eternal with the perishing things of time, and to imagine, that as corporeal things beget, so does God in like manner; it is rather our duty to rise to the truth by arguments of the contrary, and to say, that since thus is the mortal, not thus is He who is immortal.

[52:34] We must neither then deny the divine generation, nor contaminate our intelligence with corporeal senses.

[52:35] 4.

[52:36] The Holy Spirit, too, is numbered with the Father and the Son, because He is above creation, and is ranked as we are taught by the words of the Lord in the Gospel, "Go and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost".

[52:37] He who, on the contrary, places the Spirit before the Son, or alleges Him to be older than the Father, resists the ordinance of God, and is a stranger to the sound faith, since he fails to preserve the form of doxology which he has received, but adopts some new fangled device in order to be pleasing to men.

[52:38] It is written "The Spirit is of God," and if He is of God, how can He be older than that of which He is? And what folly is it not, when there is one Unbegotten, to speak of something else as superior to the Unbegotten? He is not even anterior, for nothing intervenes between Son and Father.

[52:39] If, however, He is not of God but is through Christ, He does not even exist at all.

[52:40] It follows, that this new invention about the order really involves the destruction of the actual existence, and is a denial of the whole faith.

[52:41] It is equally impious to reduce Him to the level of a creature, and to subordinate Him either to Son or to Father, either in time or in rank.

[52:42] These are the points on which I have heard that you are making enquiry.

[52:43] If the Lord grant that we meet I may possibly have more to say on these subjects, and may myself, concerning points which I am investigating, receive satisfactory information from you.

[53:1] Letter LIII.

[53:2] To the Chorepiscopi.

[53:3] 1.

[53:4] My soul is deeply pained at the enormity of the matter on which I write, if for this only, that it has caused general suspicion and talk.

[53:5] But so far it has seemed to me incredible.

[53:6] I hope then that what I am writing about it may be taken by the guilty as medicine, by the innocent as a warning, by the indifferent, in which class I trust none of you may be found, as a testimony.

[53:7] And what is it of which I speak? There is a report that some of you take money from candidates for ordination, and excuse it on grounds of religion.

[53:8] This is indeed worse.

[53:9] If any one does evil under the guise of good he deserves double punishment; because he not only does what is in itself not good, but, so to say, makes good an accomplice in the commission of sin.

[53:10] If the allegation be true, let it be so no more.

[53:11] Let a better state of things begin.

[53:12] To the recipient of the bribe it must be said, as was said by the Apostles to him who was willing to give money to buy the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, "Thy money perish with thee.

[53:13] It is a lighter sin to wish in ignorance to buy, than it is to sell, the gift of God.

[53:14] A sale it was; and if you sell what you received as a free gift you will be deprived of the boon, as though you were yourself sold to Satan.

[53:15] You are obtruding the traffic of the huckster into spiritual things and into the Church where we are entrusted with the body and blood of Christ.

[53:16] These things must not be.

[53:17] And I will mention wherein lies an ingenious contrivance.

[53:18] They think that there is no sin because they take the money not before but after the ordination; but to take is to take at whatever time.

[53:19] 2.

[53:20] I exhort you, then, abandon this gain, or, I would rather say, this approach to Hell.

[53:21] Do not, by defiling your hands with such bribes, render yourselves unfit to celebrate holy mysteries.

[53:22] But forgive me.

[53:23] I began by discrediting; and now I am threatening as though I were convinced.

[53:24] If, after this letter of mine, any one do anything of the kind, he will depart from the altars here and will seek a place where he is able to buy and to sell God's gift.

[53:25] We and the Churches of God have no such custom.

[53:26] One word more, and I have done.

[53:27] These things come of covetousness.

[53:28] Now covetousness is the root of all evil and is called idolatry.

[53:29] Do not then price idols above Christ for the sake of a little money.

[53:30] Do not imitate Judas and once more betray for a bribe Him who was crucified for us.

[53:31] For alike the lands and the hands of all that make such gain shall be called Aceldama.

[54:1] Letter LIV.

[54:2] To the Chorepiscopi.

[54:3] I am much distressed that the canons of the Fathers have fallen through, and that the exact discipline of the Church has been banished from among you.

[54:4] I am apprehensive lest, as this indifference grows, the affairs of the Church should, little by little, fall into confusion.

[54:5] According to the ancient custom observed in the Churches of God, ministers in the Church were received after careful examination; the whole of their life was investigated; an enquiry was made as to their being neither railers nor drunkards, not quick to quarrel, keeping their youth in subjection, so as to be able to maintain "the holiness without which no man shall see the Lord".

[54:6] This examination was made by presbyters and deacons living with them.

[54:7] Then they brought them to the Chorepiscopi; and the Chorepiscopi, after receiving the suffrages of the witnesses as to the truth and giving information to the Bishop, so admitted the minister to the sacerdotal order.

[54:8] Now, however, you have quite passed me over; you have not even had the grace to refer to me, and have transferred the whole authority to yourselves.

[54:9] Furthermore, with complete indifference, you have allowed presbyters and deacons to introduce unworthy persons into the Church, just any one they choose, without any previous examination of life and character, by mere favoritism, on the score of relationship or some other tie.

[54:10] The consequence is, that in every village, there are reckoned many ministers, but not one single man worthy of the service of the altars.

[54:11] Of this you yourselves supply proof from your difficulty in finding suitable candidates for election.

[54:12] As, then, I perceive that the evil is gradually reaching a point at which it would be incurable, and especially at this moment when a large number of persons are presenting themselves for the ministry through fear of the conscription, I am constrained to have recourse to the restitution of the canons of the Fathers.

[54:13] I thus order you in writing to send me the roll of the ministers in every village, stating by whom each has been introduced, and what is his mode of life.

[54:14] You have the roll in your own keeping, so that your version can be compared with the documents which are in mine, and no one can insert his own name when he likes.

[54:15] So if any have been introduced by presbyters after the first appointment, let them be rejected, and take their place among the laity.

[54:16] Their examination must then be begun by you over again, and, if they prove worthy, let them be received by your decision.

[54:17] Drive out unworthy men from the Church, and so purge it.

[54:18] For the future, test by examination those who are worthy, and then receive them; but do not reckon them of the number before you have reported to me.

[54:19] Otherwise, distinctly understand that he who is admitted to the ministry without my authority will remain a layman.

[55:1] Letter LV.

[55:2] To Paregorius, the presbyter.

[55:3] I have given patient attention to your letter, and I am astonished that when you are perfectly well able to furnish me with a short and easy defence by taking action at once, you should choose to persist in what is my ground of complaint, and endeavour to cure the incurable by writing a long story about it.

[55:4] I am not the first, Paregorius, nor the only man, to lay down the law that women are not to live with men.

[55:5] Read the canon put forth by our holy Fathers at the Council of Nicaea, which distinctly forbids subintroducts.

[55:6] Unmarried life is honourably distinguished by its being cut off from all female society.

[55:7] If, then, any one, who is known by the outward profession, in reality follows the example of those who live with wives, it is obvious that he only affects the distinction of virginity in name, and does not hold aloof from unbecoming indulgence.

[55:8] You ought to have been all the more ready to submit yourself without difficulty to my demands, in that you allege that you are free from all bodily appetite.

[55:9] I do not suppose that a man of three score years and ten lives with a woman from any such feelings, and I have not decided, as I have decided, on the ground of any crime having been committed.

[55:10] But we have learnt from the Apostle, not to put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in a brother's way;" and I know that what is done very properly by some, naturally becomes to others an occasion for sin.

[55:11] I have therefore given my order, in obedience to the injunction of the holy Fathers, that you are to separate from the woman.

[55:12] Why then, do you find fault with the Chorepiscopus? What is the good of mentioning ancient ill-will? Why do you blame me for lending an easy ear to slander? Why do you not rather lay the blame on yourself, for not consenting to break off your connexion with the woman? Expel her from your house, and establish her in a monastery.

[55:13] Let her live with virgins, and do you be served by men, that the name of God be not blasphemed in you.

[55:14] Till you have so done, the innumerable arguments, which you use in your letters, will not do you the slightest service.

[55:15] You will die useless, and you will have to give an account to God for your uselessness.

[55:16] If you persist in clinging to your clerical position without correcting your ways, you will be accursed before all the people, and all, who receive you, will be excommunicate throughout the Church.

[56:1] Letter LVI.

[56:2] To Pergamius.

[56:3] I naturally forget very easily, and I have had lately many things to do, and so my natural infirmity is increased.

[56:4] I have no doubt, therefore, that you have written to me, although I have no recollection of having received any letter from your excellency; for I am sure you would not state what is not the case.

[56:5] But for there having been no reply, it is not I that am in fault; the guilt lies with him who did not ask for one.

[56:6] Now, however, you have this letter, containing my defence for the past and affording ground for a second greeting.

[56:7] So, when you write to me, do not suppose that you are taking the initiative in another correspondence.

[56:8] You are only discharging your proper obligation in this.

[56:9] For really, although this letter of mine is a return for a previous one of yours, as it is more than twice as bulky, it will fulfil a double purpose.

[56:10] You see to what sophisms my idleness drives me.

[56:11] But, my dear Sir, do not in a few words bring serious charges, indeed the most serious of all.

[56:12] Forgetfulness of one's friends, and neglect of them arising from high place, are faults which involve every kind of wrong.

[56:13] Do we fail to love according to the commandment of the Lord? Then we lose the distinctive mark imprinted on us.

[56:14] Are we puffed to repletion with empty pride and arrogance? Then we fall into the inevitable condemnation of the devil.

[56:15] If, then, you use these words because you held such sentiments about me, pray that I may flee from the wickedness which you have found in my ways; if, however, your tongue shaped itself to these words, in a kind of inconsiderate conventionality, I shall console myself, and ask you to be good enough to adduce some tangible proof of your allegations.

[56:16] Be well assured of this, that my present anxiety is an occasion to me of humility.

[56:17] I shall begin to forget you, when I cease to know myself.

[56:18] Never, then, think that because a man is a very busy man he is a man of faulty character.

[57:1] Letter LVII.

[57:2] To Meletius, Bishop of Antioch.

[57:3] If your holiness only knew the greatness of the happiness you cause me whenever you write to me, I know that you would never have let slip any opportunity of sending me a letter; nay, you would have written me many letters on each occasion, knowing the reward that is kept in store by our loving Lord for the consolation of the afflicted.

[57:4] Everything here is still in a very painful condition, and the thought of your holiness is the only thing that recalls me from my own troubles; a thought made more distinct to me by my communication with you through that letter of yours which is so full of wisdom and grace.

[57:5] When, therefore, I take your letter into my hand, first of all, I look at its size, and I love it all the more for being so big; then, as I read it, I rejoice over every word I find in it; as I draw near the end I begin to feel sad; so good is every word that I read, in what you write.

[57:6] The overflowing of a good heart is good.

[57:7] Should I, however, be permitted, in answer to your prayers, while I live on this earth, to meet you face to face, and to enjoy the profitable instruction of your living voice, or any aids to help me in the life that now is, or that which is to come, I should count this indeed the best of blessings, a prelude to the mercy of God.

[57:8] I should, ere now, have adhered to this intention, had I not been prevented by true and loving brothers.

[57:9] I have told my brother Theophrastus to make a detailed report to you of matters, as to which I do not commit my intentions to writing.

[58:1] Letter LVIII.

[58:2] To Gregory my brother.

[58:3] How am I to dispute with you in writing? How can I lay hold of you satisfactorily, with all your simplicity? Tell me; who ever falls a third time into the same nets? Who ever gets a third time into the same snare? Even a brute beast would find it difficult to do so.

[58:4] You forged one letter, and brought it me as though it came from our right reverend uncle the bishop, trying to deceive me, I have no idea why.

[58:5] I received it as a letter written by the bishop and delivered by you.

[58:6] Why should I not? I was delighted; I shewed it to many of my friends; I thanked God.

[58:7] The forgery was found out, on the bishop's repudiating it in person.

[58:8] I was thoroughly ashamed; covered as I was with the disgrace of cunning trickery and lies, I prayed that the earth might open for me.

[58:9] Then they gave me a second letter, as sent by the bishop himself by the hands of your servant Asterius.

[58:10] Even this second had not really been sent by the bishop, as my very reverend brother Anthimus has told me.

[58:11] Now Adamantius has come bringing me a third.

[58:12] How ought I to receive a letter carried by you or yours? I might have prayed to have a heart of stone, so as neither to remember the past, nor to feel the present; so as to bear every blow, like cattle, with bowed head.

[58:13] But what am I to think, now that, after my first and second experience, I can admit nothing without positive proof? Thus I write attacking your simplicity, which I see plainly to be neither what generally becomes a Christian man, nor is appropriate to the present emergency; I write that, at least for the future, you may take care of yourself and spare me.

[58:14] I must speak to you with all freedom, and I tell you that you are an unworthy minister of things so great.

[58:15] However, whoever be the writer of the letter, I have answered as is fit.

[58:16] Whether, then, you yourself are experimenting on me, or whether really the letter which you have sent is one which you have received from the bishops, you have my answer.

[58:17] At such a time as this you ought to have borne in mind that you are my brother, and have not yet forgotten the ties of nature, and do not regard me in the light of an enemy, for I have entered on a life which is wearing out my strength, and is so far beyond my powers that it is injuring even my soul.

[58:18] Yet for all this, as you have determined to declare war against me, you ought to have come to me and shared my troubles.

[58:19] For it is said, "Brethren and help are against time of trouble".

[58:20] If the right reverend bishops are really willing to meet me, let them make known to me a place and time, and let them invite me by their own men.

[58:21] I do not refuse to meet my own uncle, but I shall not do so unless the invitation reaches me in due and proper form.

[59:1] Letter LIX.

[59:2] To Gregory, his uncle.

[59:3] 1.

[59:4] "I have long time holden my peace.

[59:5] Am I to hold my peace for ever? Shall I still further endure to enforce against myself the hardest punishment of silence, by neither writing myself, nor receiving any statement from another? By holding fast to this stern determination up to the present time I am able to apply to myself the prophet's words, "I endure patiently like travailing woman".

[59:6] Yet I am ever longing for communication either in person or by letter, and ever, for my own sins' sake, missing it.

[59:7] For I cannot imagine any reason for what is happening, other than what I am convinced is the true one, that by being cut off from your love I am expiating old sins; if indeed I am not wrong in using such a phrase as "cut off" in your case, from any one, much less from me, to whom you have always been as a father.

[59:8] Now my sin, like some dense cloud overshadowing me, has made me forget all this.

[59:9] When I reflect that the only result to me of what is going on is sorrow, how can I attribute it to anything but to my own wickedness? But if events are to be traced to sins, be this the end of my troubles; if there was any intended discipline in it, then your object has been very completely attained, for the punishment has been going on for a long time; so I groan no longer, but am the first to break silence, and beseech you to remember both me and yourself who, to a greater degree than our relationship might have demanded, have shewn me strong affection all my life.

[59:10] Now, I implore you, show kindness to the city for my sake.

[59:11] Do not on my account alienate yourself from it.

[59:12] 2.

[59:13] If, then, there is any consolation in Christ, any fellowship of the Spirit, any mercy and pity, fulfil my prayer.

[59:14] Put a stop to my depression.

[59:15] Let there be a beginning of brighter things for the future.

[59:16] Be yourself a leader to others in the road to all that is best, and follow no one else in the way to what is wrong.

[59:17] Never was any feature so characteristic of any one's body as gentleness and peace are of your soul.

[59:18] It were well becoming such a one as you are to draw all others to yourself, and to cause all who come near you to be permeated with the goodness of your nature, as with the fragrance of myrrh.

[59:19] For though there be a certain amount of opposition now, nevertheless ere long there will be a recognition of the blessings of peace.

[59:20] So long, however, as room is found for the calumnies that are bred of dissension, suspicion is sure to grow from worse to worse.

[59:21] It is most certainly unbecoming for the rest to take no notice of me, but it is especially unbecoming in your excellency.

[59:22] If I am wrong I shall be all the better for being rebuked.

[59:23] This is impossible if we never meet.

[59:24] But, if I am doing no wrong, for what am I disliked? So much I offer in my own defence.

[59:25] 3.

[59:26] As to what the Churches might say in their own behalf, perhaps it is better for me to be silent: they reap the result of our disagreement, and it is not to their gain.

[59:27] I am not speaking to indulge my grief but to put a stop to it.

[59:28] And your intelligence, I am sure, has suffered nothing to escape you.

[59:29] You will yourself be better able to discern and to tell to others points of far greater importance than I can conceive.

[59:30] You saw the mischief done to the Churches before I did; and you are grieving more than I am, for you have long learnt from the Lord not to despise even the least.

[59:31] And now the mischief is not confined to one or two, but whole cities and peoples are sharers in my calamities.

[59:32] What need to tell what kind of report will spread about me even beyond our borders? It were well for you, large hearted as you are, to leave the love of strife to others; nay rather, if it be possible, to root it from their hearts, while you yourself vanquish what is grievous by endurance.

[59:33] Any angry man can defend himself, but to rise above the actual anger belongs only to you, and any one as good as you, if such there be.

[59:34] One thing I will not say, that he who has a grudge against me is letting his anger fall on the innocent.

[59:35] Do then comfort my soul by coming to me, or by a letter, or by inviting me to come to you, or by some means or other.

[59:36] My prayer is that your piety may be seen in the Church and that you may heal at once me and the people, both by the sight of you and by the words of your good grace.

[59:37] If this be possible it is best; if you determine on any other course I shall willingly accept it.

[59:38] Only accede to my entreaty that you will give me distinct information as to what your wisdom decides.

[60:1] Letter LX.

[60:2] To Gregory his uncle.

[60:3] Formerly I was glad to see my brother.

[60:4] Why not, since he is my brother and such a brother? Now I have received him on his coming to visit me with the same feelings, and have lost none of my affection.

[60:5] God forbid that I should ever so feel as to forget the ties of nature and be at war with those who are near and dear to me.

[60:6] I have found his presence a comfort in my bodily sickness and the other troubles of my soul, and I have been especially delighted at the letter which he has brought me from your excellency.

[60:7] For a long time I have been hoping that it would come, for this only reason, that I need not add to my life any doleful episode of quarrel between kith and kin, sure to give pleasure to foes and sorrow to friends, and to be displeasing to God, Who has laid down perfect love as the distinctive characteristic of His disciples.

[60:8] So I reply, as I am indeed bound, with an earnest request for your prayers for me, and your care for me in all things, as your relative.

[60:9] Since I, from want of information, cannot clearly understand the meaning of what is going on, I have judged it right to accept the truth of the account which you are so good as to give me.

[60:10] It is for you of your wisdom to settle the rest, our meeting with one another, the fitting time and a convenient place.

[60:11] If your reverence really does not disdain to come down to my lowliness and to have speech with me, whether you wish the interview to take place in the presence of others or in private, I shall make no objection, for I have once for all made up my mind to submit to you in love, and to carry out, without exception, what your reverence enjoins on me for the glory of God.

[60:12] I have not laid my reverend brother under the necessity of reporting anything to you by word of mouth, because on the former occasion what he said was not borne out by facts.

[61:1] Letter LXI.

[61:2] To Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria.

[61:3] I have read the letter of your holiness, in which you have expressed your distress at the unhappy governor of Libya.

[61:4] I am grieved that my own country should have given birth to and nurtured such vices.

[61:5] I am grieved too that Libya, a neighbouring country, should suffer from our evils, and should have been delivered to the inhumanity of a man whose life is marked at once by cruelty and crime.

[61:6] This however is only in accordance with the wisdom of the Preacher, "Woe to thee O land when thy King is a child;" (a still further touch of trouble) and whose "Princes" do not "eat" after night but revel at mid-day, raging after other men's wives with less understanding than brute beasts.

[61:7] This man must surely look for the scourges of the righteous Judge, repaid him in exact requital for those which he himself has previously inflicted on the saints.

[61:8] Notice has been given to my Church in accordance with the letter of your reverence, and he shall be held by all as abominable, cut off from fire, water and shelter, if indeed in the case of men so possessed there is any use in general and unanimous condemnation.

[61:9] Notoriety is enough for him, and your own letter, which has been read in all directions, for I shall not fail to show it to all his friends and relatives.

[61:10] Assuredly, even if retribution does not reach him at once, as it did Pharaoh, certainly it will bring on him hereafter a heavy and hard requital.

[62:1] Letter LXII.

[62:2] To the Church of Parnassus.

[62:3] Following an ancient custom, which has obtained for many years, and at the same time shewing you love in God, which is the fruit of the Spirit, I now, my pious friends, address this letter to you.

[62:4] I feel with you at once in your grief at the event which has befallen you, and in your anxiety at the matter which you have in hand.

[62:5] Concerning all these troubles I can only say, that an occasion is given us to look to the injunctions of the Apostle, and not to sorrow "even as others which have no hope".

[62:6] I do not mean that we should be insensible to the loss we have suffered, but that we should not succumb to our sorrow, while we count the Pastor happy in his end.

[62:7] He has died in a ripe old age, and has found his rest in the great honour given him by his Lord.

[62:8] As to the future I have this recommendation to give you.

[62:9] You must now lay aside all mourning; you must come to yourselves; you must rise to the necessary management of the Church; to the end that the holy God may give heed to His own little flock, and may grant you a shepherd in accordance with His own will, who may wisely feed you.

[63:1] Letter LXIII.

[63:2] To the Governor of Neocaesarea.

[63:3] The wise man, even if he dwells far away, even if I never set eyes on him, I count a friend.

[63:4] So says the tragedian Euripides.

[63:5] And so, if, though I have never had the pleasure of meeting your excellency in person, I speak of myself as a familiar friend, pray do not set this down to mere empty compliment.

[63:6] Common report, which loudly proclaims your universal benevolence, is, in this instance, the promoter of friendship.

[63:7] Indeed since I met the highly respectable Elpidius, I have known you as well, and I have been as completely captured by you, as though I had long lived with you and had practical experience of your excellent qualities.

[63:8] For he did not cease telling me about you, mentioning one by one your magnanimity, your exalted sentiments, your mild manners, your skill in business, intelligence, dignity tempered by cheerfulness, and eloquence.

[63:9] All the other points that he enumerated in his long conversation with me it is impossible for me to write to you, without extending my letter beyond all reasonable bounds.

[63:10] How can I fail to love such a man? How could I put such restraint upon myself as not loudly to proclaim what I feel? Accept then, most excellent Sir, the greeting which I send you, for it is inspired by true and unfeigned friendship.

[63:11] I abhor all servile compliment.

[63:12] Pray keep me enrolled in the list of your friends, and, by frequently writing to me, bring yourself before me and comfort me in your absence.

[64:1] Letter LXIV.

[64:2] To Hesychius.

[64:3] From the beginning I have had many points in common with your excellency, your love of letters, everywhere reported by all who have experienced it, and our old friendship with the admirable Terentius.

[64:4] But since that most excellent man, who is to me all that friendship could require, my worthy brother Elpidius, has met me, and told me all your good qualities, (and who more capable than he at once to perceive a man's virtue and to describe it?) he has kindled in me such a desire to see you, that I pray that you may one day visit me in my old home, that I may enjoy your good qualities, not merely by hearing of them, but by actual experience.

[65:1] Letter LXV.

[65:2] To Atarbius.

[65:3] If I continue to insist on the privileges to which my superior age entitles me, and wait for you to take the initiative in communication , and if you, my friend, wish to adhere more persistently to your evil counsel of inaction, what end will there be to our silence? However, where friendship is involved, to be defeated is in my opinion to win, and so I am quite ready to gave you precedence, and retire from the contest as to which should maintain his own opinion.

[65:4] I have been the first to betake myself to writing, because I know that "charity beareth all things…endureth all things…seeketh not her own" and so "never faileth".

[65:5] He who subjects himself to his neighbour in love can never be humiliated.

[65:6] I do beg you, then, at all events for the future, show the first and greatest fruit of the Spirit, Love; away with the angry man's sullenness which you are showing me by your silence, and recover joy in your heart, peace with the brothers who are of one mind with you, and zeal and anxiety for the continued safety of the Churches of the Lord.

[65:7] If I were not to make as strenuous efforts on behalf of the Churches as the opponents of sound doctrine make to subvert and utterly destroy them, you may be quite sure that there is nothing to prevent the truth from being swept away and destroyed by its enemies, and my being involved in the condemnation, for not shewing all possible anxiety for the unity of the Churches, with all zeal and eagerness in mutual unanimity and godly agreement.

[65:8] I exhort you then, drive out of your mind the idea that you need communion with no one else.

[65:9] To cut one's self off from connexion with the brethren is not the mark of one who is walking by love, nor yet the fulfilling of the commandment of Christ.

[65:10] At the same time I do wish you, with all your good intentions, to take into account that the calamities of the war which are now all round about us may one day be at our own doors, and if we too, like all the rest, have our share of outrage, we shall not find any even to sympathise with us, because in the hour of our prosperity we refused to give our share of sympathy to the wronged.

[66:1] Letter LXVI.

[66:2] To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria.

[66:3] No one, I feel sure, is more distressed at the present condition, or, rather to speak more truly, ill condition of the Churches than your excellency; for you compare the present with the past, and take into account how great a change has come about.

[66:4] You are well aware that if no check is put to the swift deterioration which we are witnessing, there will soon be nothing to prevent the complete transformation of the Churches.

[66:5] And if the decay of the Churches seems so pitiful to me, what must—so I have often in my lonely musings reflected—be the feelings of one who has known, by experience, the old tranquillity of the Churches of the Lord, and their one mind about the faith? But as your excellency feels most deeply this distress, it seems to me only becoming that your wisdom should be more strongly moved to interest itself in the Church's behalf.

[66:6] I for my part have long been aware, so far as my moderate intelligence has been able to judge of current events, that the one way of safety for the Churches of the East lies in their having the sympathy of the bishops of the West.

[66:7] For if only those bishops liked to show the same energy on behalf of the Christians sojourning in our part of the world which they have shewn in the case of one or two of the men convicted of breaches of orthodoxy in the West, our common interests would probably reap no small benefit, our sovereigns treating the authority of the people with respect, and the laity in all quarters unhesitatingly following them.

[66:8] But, to carry out these objects, who has more capacity than yourself, with your intelligence and prudence? Who is keener to see the needful course to be taken? Who has more practical experience in working a profitable policy? Who feels more deeply the troubles of the brethren? What through all the West is more honoured than your venerable gray hairs? O most honoured father, leave behind you some memorial worthy of your life and character.

[66:9] By this one act crown your innumerable efforts on behalf of true religion.

[66:10] Despatch from the holy Church placed under your care men of ability in sound doctrine to the bishops in the West.

[66:11] Recount to them the troubles whereby we are beset.

[66:12] Suggest some mode of relief.

[66:13] Be a Samuel to the Churches.

[66:14] Share the grief of the beleaguered people.

[66:15] Offer prayers for peace.

[66:16] Ask favour from the Lord, that He will send some memorial of peace to the Churches.

[66:17] I know how weak letters are to move men in matters of such importance; but you yourself no more need exhortation from others than the noblest athletes need the children's cheers.

[66:18] It is not as though I were instructing one in ignorance; I am only giving a new impulse to one whose energies are already roused.

[66:19] For the rest of the affairs of the East perhaps you may need the aid of more, and we must wait for the Westerns.

[66:20] But plainly the discipline of the Church of Antioch depends upon your reverence's being able to control some, to reduce others to silence, and to restore strength to the Church by concord.

[66:21] No one knows better than you do, that, like all wise physicians, you ought to begin your treatment in the most vital parts, and what part is more vital to the Churches throughout the world than Antioch? Only let Antioch be restored to harmony, and nothing will stand in the way of her supplying, as a healthy head, soundness to all the body.

[66:22] Truly the diseases of that city, which has not only been cut asunder by heretics, but is torn in pieces by men who say that they are of one mind with one another, stand in need of your wisdom and evangelic sympathy.

[66:23] To unite the sundered parts again, and bring about the harmony of one body, belongs to Him alone Who by His ineffable power grants even to the dry bones to come back again to sinews and flesh.

[66:24] But the Lord always works His mighty works by means of them that are worthy of Him.

[66:25] Once again, in this case too, we trust that the ministry of matters so important may beseem your excellency, with the result that you will lay the tempest of the people, do away with the party superiorities, and subject all to one another in love, and give back to the Church her ancient strength.

[67:1] Letter LXVII.

[67:2] To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria.

[67:3] In my former letter it seemed to me sufficient to point out to your excellency, that all that portion of the people of the holy Church of Antioch who are sound in the faith, ought to be brought to concord and unity.

[67:4] My object was to make it plain that the sections, now divided into several parts, ought to be united under the God-beloved bishop Meletius.

[67:5] Now the same beloved deacon, Dorotheus, has requested a more distinct statement on these subjects, and I am therefore constrained to point out that it is the prayer of the whole East, and the earnest desire of one who, like myself, is so wholly united to him, to see him in authority over the Churches of the Lord.

[67:6] He is a man of unimpeachable faith; his manner of life is incomparably excellent, he stands at the head, so to say, of the whole body of the Church, and all else are mere disjointed members.

[67:7] On every ground, then, it is necessary as well as advantageous, that the rest should be united with him, just as smaller streams with great ones.

[67:8] About the rest, however, a certain amount of management is needed, befitting their position, and likely to pacify the people.

[67:9] This is in keeping with your own wisdom, and with your famous readiness and energy.

[67:10] It has however by no means escaped your intelligence, that this same course of procedure has already recommended itself to the Westerns who are in agreement with you, as I learn from the letters brought to me by the blessed Silvanus.

[68:1] Letter LXVIII.

[68:2] To Meletius, bishop of Antioch.

[68:3] I wished to detain the reverend brother Dorotheus, the deacon, so long at my side, with the object of keeping him until the end of the negociations, and so by him acquainting your excellency with every detail.

[68:4] But day after day went by; the delay was becoming protracted; now, the moment that some plan, so far as is possible in my difficulties, has occurred to me concerning the course to be taken, I send him to approach your holiness, to make a personal report to you on all the circumstances, and show you my memorandum, to the end that, if what has occurred to me seems to you to be likely to be of service, your excellency may urge on its accomplishment.

[68:5] To be brief, the opinion has prevailed that it is best for this our brother Dorotheus to travel to Rome, to move some of the Italians to undertake a voyage by sea to visit us, that they may avoid all who would put difficulties in their way.

[68:6] My reason for this course is that I see that those, who are all powerful with the Emperor, are neither willing nor able to make any suggestion to him about the exiled, but only count it so much to the good that they see no worse thing befalling the Churches.

[68:7] If, then, my plan seems good also to your prudence, you will be good enough both to indite letters and dictate memoranda as to the points on which he must enlarge, and as to whom he had better address himself.

[68:8] And so that your despatches may have weight and authority, you will add all those who share your sentiments, even though they are not on the spot.

[68:9] Here all is uncertain; Euippius has arrived, but so far has made no sign.

[68:10] However, he and those who think with him from the Armenian Tetrapolis and Cilicia are threatening a tumultuous meeting.

[69:1] Letter LXIX.

[69:2] To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria.

[69:3] 1.

[69:4] As time moves on, it continually confirms the opinion which I have long held of your holiness; or rather that opinion is strengthened by the daily course of events.

[69:5] Most men are indeed satisfied with observing, each one, what lies especially within his own province; not thus is it with you, but your anxiety for all the Churches is no less than that which you feel for the Church that has been especially entrusted to you by our common Lord; inasmuch as you leave no interval in speaking, exhorting, writing, and despatching emissaries, who from time to time give the best advice in each emergency as it arises.

[69:6] Now, from the sacred ranks of your clergy, you have sent forth the venerable brother Peter, whom I have welcomed with great joy.

[69:7] I have also approved of the good object of his journey, which he manifests in accordance with the commands of your excellency, in effecting reconciliation where he finds opposition, and bringing about union instead of division.

[69:8] With the object of offering some contribution to the action which is being taken in this matter, I have thought that I could not make a more fitting beginning than by having recourse to your excellency, as to the head and chief of all, and treating you as alike adviser and commander in the enterprise.

[69:9] I have therefore determined to send to your reverence our brother Dorotheus the deacon, of the Church under the right honourable bishop Meletius, being one who at once is an energetic supporter of the orthodox faith, and is earnestly desirous of seeing the peace of the Churches.

[69:10] The results, I hope, will be, that, following your suggestions (which you are able to make with the less likelihood of failure, both from your age and your experience in affairs, and because you have a greater measure than all others of the aid of the Spirit), he may thus attempt the achievement of our objects.

[69:11] You will welcome him, I am sure, and will look upon him with friendly eyes.

[69:12] You will strengthen him by the help of your prayers; you will give him a letter as provision by the way; you will grant him, as companions, some of the good men and true that you have about you; so you will speed him on the road to what is before him.

[69:13] It has seemed to me to be desirable to send a letter to the bishop of Rome, begging him to examine our condition, and since there are difficulties in the way of representatives being sent from the West by a general synodical decree, to advise him to exercise his own personal authority in the matter by choosing suitable persons to sustain the labours of a journey,—suitable, too, by gentleness and firmness of character, to correct the unruly among us here; able to speak with proper reserve and appropriateness, and thoroughly well acquainted with all that has been effected after Ariminum to undo the violent measures adopted there.

[69:14] I should advise that, without any one knowing anything about it, they should travel hither, attracting as little attention as possible, by the sea, with the object of escaping the notice of the enemies of peace.

[69:15] 2.

[69:16] A point also that is insisted upon by some of those in these parts, very necessarily, as is plain even to myself, is that they should drive away the heresy of Marcellus, as grievous and injurious and opposed to the sound faith.

[69:17] For up to this time, in all the letters which they write, they are constant in thoroughly anathematizing the ill-famed Arius and in repudiating him from the Churches.

[69:18] But they attach no blame to Marcellus, who propounded a heresy diametrically opposite to that of Arius, and impiously attacked the very existence of the Only begotten Godhead, and erroneously understood the term "Word".

[69:19] He grants indeed that the Only begotten was called "Word," on coming forth at need and in season, but states that He returned again to Him whence He had come forth, and had no existence before His coming forth, nor hypostasis after His return.

[69:20] The books in my possession which contain his unrighteous writings exist as a proof of what I say.

[69:21] Nevertheless they nowhere openly condemned him, and are to this extent culpable that, being from the first in ignorance of the truth, they received him into the communion of the Church.

[69:22] The present state of affairs makes it specially necessary that attention should be called to him, so that those who seek for their opportunity, may be prevented from getting it, from the fact of sound men being united to your holiness, and all who are lame in the true faith may be openly known; that so we may know who are on our side, and may not struggle, as in a night battle, without being able to distinguish between friends and foes.

[69:23] Only I do beseech you that the deacon, whom I have mentioned, be despatched by the earliest possible packet, that at least some of the ends which we pray for may be accomplished during the ensuing year.

[69:24] One thing, however, even before I mention it, you quite understand and I am sure will give heed to, that, when they come, if God will, they must not let loose schisms among the Churches; and, even though they find some who have personal reasons for mutual differences, they must leave no means untried to unite all who are of the same way of thinking.

[69:25] For we are bound to regard the interests of peace as paramount, and that first of all attention be paid to the Church at Antioch, lest the sound portion of it grow diseased through division on personal grounds.

[69:26] But you will yourself give more complete attention to all these matters, so soon as, by the blessing of God, you find every one entrusting to you the responsibility of securing the peace of the Church.

[70:1] Letter LXX.

[70:2] Without address.

[70:3] To renew laws of ancient love, and once again to restore to vigorous life that heavenly and saving gift of Christ which in course of time has withered away, the peace, I mean, of the Fathers, is a labour necessary indeed and profitable to me, but pleasant too, as I am sure it will seem to your Christ-loving disposition.

[70:4] For what could be more delightful than to behold all, who are separated by distances so vast, bound together by the union effected by love into one harmony of members in Christ's body? Nearly all the East (I include under this name all the regions from Illyricum to Egypt) is being agitated, right honourable father, by a terrible storm and tempest.

[70:5] The old heresy, sown by Arius the enemy of the truth, has now boldly and unblushingly reappeared.

[70:6] Like some sour root, it is producing its deadly fruit and is prevailing.

[70:7] The reason of this is, that in every district the champions of right doctrine have been exiled from their Churches by calumny and outrage, and the control of affairs has been handed over to men who are leading captive the souls of the simpler brethren.

[70:8] I have looked upon the visit of your mercifulness as the only possible solution of our difficulties.

[70:9] Ever in the past I have been consoled by your extraordinary affection; and for a short time my heart was cheered by the gratifying report that we shall be visited by you.

[70:10] But, as I was disappointed, I have been constrained to beseech you by letter to be moved to help us, and to send some of those, who are like minded with us, either to conciliate the dissentient and bring back the Churches of God into friendly union, or at all events to make you see more plainly who are responsible for the unsettled state in which we are, that it may be obvious to you for the future with whom it befits you to be in communion.

[70:11] In this I am by no means making any novel request, but am only asking what has been customary in the case of men who, before our own day, were blessed and dear to God, and conspicuously in your own case.

[70:12] For I well remember learning from the answers made by our fathers when asked, and from documents still preserved among us, that the illustrious and blessed bishop Dionysius, conspicuous in your see as well for soundness of faith as for all other virtues, visited by letter my Church of Caesarea, and by letter exhorted our fathers, and sent men to ransom our brethren from captivity.

[70:13] But now our condition is yet more painful and gloomy and needs more careful treatment.

[70:14] We are lamenting no mere overthrow of earthly buildings, but the capture of Churches; what we see before us is no mere bodily slavery, but a carrying away of souls into captivity, perpetrated day by day by the champions of heresy.

[70:15] Should you not, even now, be moved to succour us, ere long all will have fallen under the dominion of the heresy, and you will find none left to whom you may hold out your hand.

[71:1] Letter LXXI.

[71:2] Basil to Gregory.

[71:3] 1.

[71:4] I have received the letter of your holiness, by the most reverend brother Helenius, and what you have intimated he has told me in plain terms.

[71:5] How I felt on hearing it, you cannot doubt at all.

[71:6] However, since I have determined that my affection for you shall outweigh my pain, whatever it is, I have accepted it as I ought to do, and I pray the holy God, that my remaining days or hours may be as carefully conducted in their disposition towards you as they have been in past time, during which, my conscience tells me, I have been wanting to you in nothing small or great.

[71:7] [But that the man who boasts that he is now just beginning to take a look at the life of Christians, and thinks he will get some credit by having something to do with me, should invent what he has not heard, and narrate what he has never experienced, is not at all surprising.

[71:8] What is surprising and extraordinary is that he has got my best friends among the brethren at Nazianzus to listen to him; and not only to listen to him, but as it seems, to take in what he says.

[71:9] On most grounds it might be surprising that the slanderer is of such a character, and that I am the victim, but these troublous times have taught us to bear everything with patience.

[71:10] Slights greater than this have, for my sins, long been things of common occurrence with me.

[71:11] I have never yet given this man's brethren any evidence of my sentiments about God, and I have no answer to make now.

[71:12] Men who are not convinced by long experience are not likely to be convinced by a short letter.

[71:13] If the former is enough let the charges of the slanderers be counted as idle tales.

[71:14] But if I give license to unbridled mouths, and uninstructed hearts, to talk about whom they will, all the while keeping my ears ready to listen, I shall not be alone in hearing what is said by other people; they will have to hear what I have to say.

[71:15] ]  2.

[71:16] I know what has led to all this, and have urged every topic to hinder it; but now I am sick of the subject, and will say no more about it, I mean our little intercourse.

[71:17] For had we kept our old promise to each other, and had due regard to the claims which the Churches have on us, we should have been the greater part of the year together; and then there would have been no opening for these calumniators.

[71:18] Pray have nothing to say to them; let me persuade you to come here and assist me in my labours, particularly in my contest with the individual who is now assailing me.

[71:19] Your very appearance will have the effect of stopping him; directly you show these disturbers of our home that you will, by God's blessing, place yourself at the head of our party, you will break up their cabal, and you will shut every unjust mouth that speaketh unrighteousness against God.

[71:20] And thus facts will show who are your followers in good, and who are the halters and cowardly betrayers of the word of truth.

[71:21] If, however, the Church be betrayed, why then I shall care little to set men right about myself, by means of words, who account of me as men would naturally account who have not yet learned to measure themselves.

[71:22] Perhaps, in a short time, by God's grace, I shall be able to refute their slanders by very deed, for it seems likely that I shall have soon to suffer somewhat for the truth's sake more than usual; the best I can expect is banishment, or, if this hope fails, after all Christ's judgment-seat is not far distant.

[71:23] [If then you ask for a meeting for the Churches' sake, I am ready to betake myself whithersoever you invite me.

[71:24] But if it is only a question of refuting these slanders, I really have no time to reply to them.

[71:25] ].

[72:1] Letter LXXII.

[72:2] To Hesychius.

[72:3] I know your affection for me, and your zeal for all that is good.

[72:4] I am exceedingly anxious to pacify my very dear son Callisthenes, and I thought that if I could associate you with me in this I might more easily achieve my object.

[72:5] Callisthenes is very much annoyed at the conduct of Eustochius, and he has very good ground for being so.

[72:6] He charges the household of Eustochius with impudence and violence against himself.

[72:7] I am begging him to be propitiated, satisfied with the fright which he has given the impudent fellows and their master, and to forgive, and end the quarrel.

[72:8] Thus two results will follow; he will win the respect of men, and praise with God, if only he will combine forbearance with threats.

[72:9] If you have any friendship and intimacy with him, pray ask this favour of him, and, if you know any in the town likely to be able to move him, get them to act with you, and tell them that it will be specially gratifying to me.

[72:10] Send back the deacon so soon as his commission is performed.

[72:11] After men have fled for refuge to me, I should be ashamed not to be able to be of any use to them.

[73:1] Letter LXXIII.

[73:2] To Callisthenes.

[73:3] 1.

[73:4] When I had read your letter I thanked God; first, that I been greeted by a man desirous of doing me honour, for truly I highly estimate any intercourse with persons of high merit; secondly, with pleasure at the thought of being remembered.

[73:5] For a letter is a sign of remembrance; and when I had received yours and learnt its contents I was astonished to find how, as all were agreed, it paid me the respect due to a father from a son.

[73:6] That a man in the heat of anger and indignation, eager to punish those who had annoyed him, should drop more than half his vehemence and give me authority to decide the matter, caused me to feel such joy as I might over a son in the spirit.

[73:7] In return, what remains for me but to pray for all blessings for you? May you be a delight to your friends, a terror to your foes, an object of respect to all, to the end that any who fall short in their duty to you may, when they learn how gentle you are, only blame themselves for having wronged one of such a character as yourself!  2.

[73:8] I should be very glad to know the object which your goodness has in view, in ordering the servants to be conveyed to the spot where they were guilty of their disorderly conduct.

[73:9] If you come yourself, and exact in person the punishment due for the offence, the slaves shall be there.

[73:10] What other course is possible if you have made up your mind? Only that I do not know what further favour I shall have received, if I shall have failed to get the boys off their punishment.

[73:11] But if business detain you on the way, who is to receive the fellows there? Who is to punish them in your stead? But if you have made up your mind to meet them yourself, and this is quite determined on, tell them to halt at Sasima, and there show the extent of your gentleness and magnanimity.

[73:12] After having your assailants in your own power, and so showing them that your dignity is not to be lightly esteemed, let them go scot free, as I urged you in my former letter.

[73:13] So you will confer a favour on me, and will receive the requital of your good deed from God.

[73:14] 3.

[73:15] I speak in this way, not because the business ought so to be ended, but as a concession to your agitated feelings, and in fear lest somewhat of your wrath may remain still raw.

[73:16] When a man's eyes are inflamed the softest application seems painful, and I am afraid lest what I say may rather irritate than calm you.

[73:17] What would really be most becoming, bringing great credit to you, and no little cause of honour to me with my friends and contemporaries, would be for you to leave the punishment to me.

[73:18] And although you have sworn to deliver them to execution as the law enjoins, my rebuke is still of no less value as a punishment, nor is the divine law of less account than the laws current in the world.

[73:19] But it will be possible for them, by being punished here by our laws, wherein too lies your own hope of salvation, both to release you from your oath and to undergo a penalty commensurate with their faults.

[73:20] But once more I am making my letter too long.

[73:21] In the very earnest desire to persuade you I cannot bear to leave unsaid any of the pleas which occur to me, and I am much afraid lest my entreaty should prove ineffectual from my failing to say all that may convey my meaning.

[73:22] Now, true and honoured son of the Church, confirm the hopes which I have of you; prove true all the testimony unanimously given to your placability and gentleness.

[73:23] Give orders to the soldier to leave me without delay; he is now as tiresome and rude as he can well be; he evidently prefers giving no cause of annoyance to you to making all of us here his close friends.

[74:1] Letter LXXIV.

[74:2] To Martinianus.

[74:3] 1.

[74:4] How high do you suppose one to prize the pleasure of our meeting one another once again? How delightful to spend longer time with you so as to enjoy all your good qualities! If powerful proof is given of culture in seeing many men's cities and knowing many men's ways, such I am sure is quickly given in your society.

[74:5] For what is the difference between seeing many men singly or one who has gained experience of all together? I should say that there is an immense superiority in that which gives us the knowledge of good and beautiful things without trouble, and puts within our reach instruction in virtue, pure from all admixture of evil.

[74:6] Is there question of noble deed; of words worth handing down; of institutions of men of superhuman excellence? All are treasured in the store house of your mind.

[74:7] Not then, would I pray, that I might listen to you, like Alcinous to Ulysses, only for a year, but throughout all my life; and to this end I would pray that my life might be long, even though my state were no easy one.

[74:8] Why, then, am I now writing when I ought to be coming to see you? Because my country in her troubles calls me irresistibly to her side.

[74:9] You know, my friend, how she suffers.

[74:10] She is torn in pieces like Pentheus by veritable Maenads, daemons.

[74:11] They are dividing her, and dividing her again, like bad surgeons who, in their ignorance, make wounds worse.

[74:12] Suffering as she is from this dissection, it remains for me to tend her like a sick patient.

[74:13] So the Caesareans have urgently appealed to me by letter, and I must go, not as though I could be of any help, but to avoid any blame of neglect.

[74:14] You know how ready men in difficulties are to hope; and ready too, I ween, to find fault, always charging their troubles on what has been left undone.

[74:15] 2.

[74:16] Yet for this very reason I ought to have come to see you, and to have told you my mind, or rather to implore you to bethink you of some strong measure worthy of your wisdom; not to turn aside from my country falling on her knees, but to betake yourself to the Court, and, with the boldness which is all your own, not to let them suppose that they own two provinces instead of one.

[74:17] They have not imported the second from some other part of the world, but have acted somewhat in the same way in which some owner of horse or ox might act, who should cut it in two, and then think that he had two instead of one, instead of failing to make two and destroying the one he had.

[74:18] Tell the Emperor and his ministers that they are not after this fashion increasing the empire, for power lies not in number but in condition.

[74:19] I am sure that now men are neglecting the course of events, some, possibly, from ignorance of the truth, some from their being unwilling to say anything offensive, some because it does not immediately concern them.

[74:20] The course likely to be most beneficial, and worthy of your high principles, would be for you, if possible, to approach the Emperor in person.

[74:21] If this is difficult both on account of the season of the year and of your age, of which, as you say, inactivity is the foster brother, at all events you need have no difficulty in writing.

[74:22] If you thus give our country the aid of a letter, you will first of all have the satisfaction of knowing that you have left nothing undone that was in your power, and further, by showing sympathy, if only in appearance, you will give the patient much comfort.

[74:23] Would only that it were possible for you to come yourself among us and actually see our deplorable condition! Thus, perhaps, stirred by the plain evidence before you, you might have spoken in terms worthy alike of your own magnanimity and of the affliction of Caesarea.

[74:24] But do not withhold belief from what I am telling you.

[74:25] Verily we want some Simonides, or other like poet, to lament our troubles from actual experience.

[74:26] But why name Simonides? I should rather mention aeschylus, or any other who has set forth a great calamity in words like his, and uttered lamentation with a mighty voice.

[74:27] 3.

[74:28] Now we have no more meetings, no more debates, no more gatherings of wise men in the Forum, nothing more of all that made our city famous.

[74:29] In our Forum nowadays it would be stranger for a learned or eloquent man to put in an appearance, than it would for men, shewing a brand of iniquity or unclean hands, to have presented themselves in Athens of old.

[74:30] Instead of them we have the imported boorishness of Massagetae and Scythians.

[74:31] And only one noise is heard of drivers of bargains, and losers of bargains, and of fellows under the lash.

[74:32] On either hand the porticoes resound with doleful echoes, as though they were uttering a natural and proper sound in groaning at what is going on.

[74:33] Our distress prevents our paying any attention to locked gymnasia and nights when no torch is lighted.

[74:34] There is no small danger lest, our magistrates being removed, everything crash down together as with fallen props.

[74:35] What words can adequately describe our calamities? Some have fled into exile, a considerable portion of our senate, and that not the least valuable, prefering perpetual banishment to Podandus.

[74:36] When I mention Podandus, suppose me to mean the Spartan Ceadas or any natural pit that you may have seen, spots breathing a noxious vapour, to which some have involuntarily given the name Charonian.

[74:37] Picture to yourself that the evils of Podandus are a match for such a place.

[74:38] So, of three parts, some have left their homes and are in exile, wives and hearth and all; some are being led away like captives, the majority of the best men in the city, a piteous spectacle to their friends, fulfilling their enemies' prayers; if, that is, any one has ever been found to call down so dire a curse upon our heads.

[74:39] A third division yet remains: these, unable to endure abandonment by their old companions, and at the same time unable to provide for themselves, have to hate their very lives.

[74:40] This is what I implore you to make known everywhere with an eloquence all your own, and that righteous boldness of speech which your manner of life gives you.

[74:41] One thing distinctly state; that, unless the authorities soon change their counsels, they will find none left on whom to exercise their clemency.

[74:42] You will either prove some help to the state, or at least you will have done as Solon did, who, when he was unable to defend his abandoned fellow citizens on the capture of the Acropolis, put on his armour, and sat down before the gates, thus making it plain by this guise that he was no party to what was going on.

[74:43] Of one thing I am assured, even though at the present moment there may be some who do not approve of your advice, the day is not far distant when they will give you the greatest credit for benevolence and sagacity, because they see events corresponding with your prediction.

[75:1] Letter LXXV.

[75:2] To Aburgius.

[75:3] You have many qualities which raise you above the common run of men, but nothing is more distinctly characteristic of you than your zeal for your country.

[75:4] Thus you, who have risen to such a height as to become illustrious throughout all the world, pay a righteous recompense to the land that gave you birth.

[75:5] Yet she, your mother city, who bore you and nursed you, has fallen into the incredible condition of ancient story; and no one visiting Caesarea; not even those most familiar with her, would recognise her as she is; to such complete abandonment has she been suddenly transformed, many of her magistrates having been previously removed, and now nearly all of them transferred to Podandus.

[75:6] The remainder, torn from these like mutilated extremities, have themselves fallen into complete despair, and have caused such a general weight of despondency, that the population of the city is now but scanty; the place looks like a desert, a piteous spectacle to all who love it, and a cause for delight and encouragement to all who have long been plotting for our fall.

[75:7] Who then will reach out a hand to help us? Who will drop a tear of pity over our faith? You have sympathised with a stranger city in like distress; will not your kindly excellency feel for her who gave you birth? If you have any influence, show it in our present need.

[75:8] Certainly you have great help from God, Who has never abandoned you, and has given you many proofs of His kindness.

[75:9] Only be willing to exert yourself in our behalf, and use all the influence you have for the succour of your fellow citizens.

[76:1] Letter LXXVI.

[76:2] To Sophronius the Master.

[76:3] The greatness of the calamities, which have befallen our native city, did seem likely to compel me to travel in person to the court, and there to relate, both to your excellency and to all those who are most influential in affairs, the dejected state in which Caesarea is lying.

[76:4] But I am kept here alike by ill-health and by the care of the Churches.

[76:5] In the meantime, therefore, I hasten to tell your lordship our troubles by letter, and to acquaint you that never ship, drowned in sea by furious winds, so suddenly disappeared, never city shattered by earthquake or overwhelmed by flood, so swiftly vanished out of sight, as our city, engulfed by this new constitution, has gone utterly to ruin.

[76:6] Our misfortunes have passed into a tale.

[76:7] Our institutions are a thing of the past; and all our men of high civil rank, in despair at what has happened to our magistrates, have left their homes in the city and are wandering about the country.

[76:8] There is a break therefore in the necessary conduct of affairs, and the city, which ere now gloried both in men of learning and in others who abound in opulent towns, has become a most unseemly spectacle.

[76:9] One only consolation have we left in our troubles, and that is to groan over our misfortunes to your excellency and to implore you, if you can, to reach out the helping hand to Caesarea who falls on her knees before you.

[76:10] How indeed you may be able to aid us I am not myself able to explain; but I am sure that to you, with all your intelligence, it will be easy to discover the means, and not difficult, through the power given you by God, to use them when they are found.

[77:1] Letter LXXVII.

[77:2] Without inscription: about Therasius.

[77:3] One good thing we have certainly gained from the government of the great Therasius and that is that you have frequently paid us a visit.

[77:4] Now, alas! we have lost our governor, and we are deprived of this good thing too.

[77:5] But since the boons once given us by God remain immovable, and, although we are parted in body, abide fixed by memory in the souls of each of us, let us constantly write, and communicate our needs to one another.

[77:6] And this we may well do at the present moment, when the storm for a brief space has cried a truce.

[77:7] I trust that you will not part from the admirable Therasius, for I think that it is very becoming to share his great anxieties, and I am delighted at the opportunity given you both of seeing your friends and of being seen by them.

[77:8] I have much to say about many things, but I put it off till we meet, for it is, I think, hardly safe to entrust matters of such importance to letters.

[78:1] Letter LXXVIII.

[78:2] Without inscription, on behalf of Elpidius.

[78:3] I have not failed to observe the interest you have shown in our venerable friend Elpidius; and how with your usual intelligence you have given the prefect an opportunity of showing his kindness.

[78:4] What I am now writing to ask you is to make this favour complete and suggest to the prefect that he should by a particular order set over our city the man who is full of all possible care for the public interests.

[78:5] You will therefore have many admirable reasons to urge upon the prefect for his ordering Elpidius to remain at Caesarea.

[78:6] There is at all events no need for you to be taught by me, since you yourself know only too well, what is the position of affairs, and how capable Elpidius in administration.

[79:1] Letter LXXIX.

[79:2] To Eustathius bishop of Sebastia.

[79:3] Even before receiving your letter I knew what trouble you are ready to undergo for every one, and specially for my humble self because I am exposed in this struggle.

[79:4] So when I received your letter from the reverend Eleusinius, and saw him actually before my face, I praised God for bestowing on me such a champion and comrade, in my struggles on behalf of true religion by the aid of the Spirit.

[79:5] Be it known to your exalted reverence that I have hitherto sustained some attacks from high magistrates, and these no light ones; while both the prefect and the high chamberlain pleaded with sympathy for my opponents.

[79:6] But, so far, I have sustained every assault unmoved, by that mercy of God which supplies to me the aid of the Spirit, and strengthens my weakness through Him.

[80:1] Letter LXXX.

[80:2] To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria.

[80:3] The worse the diseases of the Churches grow, the more do we all turn to your excellency, in the belief that your championship is the one consolation left to us in our troubles.

[80:4] By the power of your prayers, and your knowledge of what is the best course to suggest in the emergency, you are believed to be able to save us from this terrible tempest by all alike who know your excellency even to a small extent, whether by hearsay or by personal experience.

[80:5] Wherefore, cease not, I implore, to pray for our souls and to rouse us by your letters.

[80:6] Did you but know of what service these are to us you would never have lost a single opportunity of writing.

[80:7] Could I only, by the aid of your prayers, be deemed worthy of seeing you, and of enjoying your good qualities, and of adding to the story of my life a meeting with your truly great and apostolical soul, then I should indeed believe that I had received from God's mercy a consolation equivalent to all the afflictions of my life.

[81:1] Letter LXXXI.

[81:2] To Bishop Innocent.

[81:3] I was delighted to receive the letter your affection sent me; but I am equally grieved at your having laid on me the load of a responsibility which is more than I can carry.

[81:4] How can I, so far removed as I am, undertake so great a charge? As long as the Church possesses you, it rests as it were on its proper buttress.

[81:5] Should the Lord be pleased to make some dispensation in the matter of your life, whom, from among us here can I send to take the charge of the brethren, who will be in like esteem with yourself? That is a very wise and proper wish which you express in your letter, that while you are yet alive you may see the successor destined after you to guide the chosen flock of the Lord (like the blessed Moses, who both wished and saw).

[81:6] As the place is great and famous, and your work has great and wide renown, and the times are difficult, needing no insignificant guide on account of the continuous storms and tempests which are attacking the Church, I have not thought it safe for my own soul to treat the matter perfunctorily, specially when I bear in mind the terms in which you write.

[81:7] For you say that, accusing me of disregard of the Churches, you mean to withstand me before the Lord.

[81:8] Not then to be at issue with you, but rather to have you on my side in my defence which I make in the presence of Christ I have, after looking round in the assembly of the presbyters of the city, chosen the very honourable vessel, the offspring of the blessed Hermogenes, who wrote the great and invincible creed in the great Synod.

[81:9] He is a presbyter of the Church, of many years standing, of steadfast character, skilled in canons, accurate in the faith, who has lived up to this time in continence and ascetic discipline, although the severity of his austere life has now subdued the flesh; a man of poverty, with no resources in this world, so that he is not even provided with bare bread, but by the labour of his hands gets a living with the brethren who dwell with him.

[81:10] It is my intention to send him.

[81:11] If, then, this is the kind of man you want, and not some younger man fit only to be sent and to discharge the common duties of this world, be so good as to write to me at the first opportunity, that I may send you this man, who is elect of God, adapted for the present work, respected by all who meet him, and who instructs with meekness all who differ from him.

[81:12] I might have sent him at once, but since you yourself had anticipated me in asking for a man of honourable character, and beloved by myself, but far inferior to the one whom I have indicated, I wished my mind in the matter to be made known to you.

[81:13] If therefore this is the kind of man you want, either send one of the brethren to fetch him at the time of the fast, or, if you have no one able to undertake the journey to me, let me know by letter.

[82:1] Letter LXXXII.

[82:2] To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria.

[82:3] When I turn my gaze upon the world, and perceive the difficulties by which every effort after good is obstructed, like those of a man walking in fetters, I am brought to despair of myself.

[82:4] But then I direct my gaze in the direction of your reverence; I remember that our Lord has appointed you to be physician of the diseases in the Churches; and I recover my spirits, and rise from the depression of despair to the hope of better things.

[82:5] As your wisdom well knows, the whole Church is undone.

[82:6] And you see everything in all directions in your mind's eye like a man looking from some tall watch tower, as when at sea many ships sailing together are all dashed one against the other by the violence of the waves, and shipwreck arises in some cases from the sea being furiously agitated from without, in others from the disorder of the sailors hindering and crowding one another.

[82:7] It is enough to present this picture, and to say no more.

[82:8] Your wisdom requires nothing farther, and the present state of affairs does not allow me freedom of speech.

[82:9] What capable pilot can be found in such a storm? Who is worthy to rouse the Lord to rebuke the wind and the sea? Who but he who from his boyhood fought a good fight on behalf of true religion? Since now truly all that is sound among us is moving in the direction of fellowship and unity with those who are of the same opinion, we have come confidently to implore you to send us a single letter, advising us what is to be done.

[82:10] In this way they wish that they may have a beginning of communication which may promote unity.

[82:11] They may, peradventure, be suspected by you, when you remember the past, and therefore, most God-beloved Father, do as follows; send me the letters to the bishops, either by the hand of some one in whom you place trust in Alexandria, or by the hand of our brother Dorotheus the deacon: when I have received these letters I will not deliver them till I have got the bishops' answers; if not, let me "bear the blame for ever".

[82:12] Truly this ought not to have struck more awe into him who first uttered it to his father, than into me who now say it to my spiritual father.

[82:13] If however you altogether renounce this hope, at least free me from all blame in acting as I have, for I have undertaken this message and mediation in all sincerity and simplicity, from desire for peace and the mutual intercourse of all who think alike about the Lord.

[83:1] Letter LXXXIII.

[83:2] To a Magistrate.

[83:3] I have had only a short acquaintance and intercourse with your lordship, but I have no small or contemptible knowledge of you from the reports through which I am brought into communication with many men of position and importance.

[83:4] You yourself are better able to say whether I, by report, am of any account with you.

[83:5] At all events your reputation with me is such as I have said.

[83:6] But since God has called you to an occupation which gives you opportunity of showing kindness, and in the exercise of which it lies in your power to bring about the restoration of my own city, now level with the ground, it is, I think, only my duty to remind your excellency that in the hope of the requital God will give, you should show yourself of such a character as to win a memory that cannot die, and be made an inheritor of everlasting rest, in consequence of your making the afflictions of the distressed hard to bear.

[83:7] I have a property at Chamanene, and I beg you to look after its interests as though they were your own.

[83:8] And pray do not be surprised at my calling my friend's property my own, for among other virtues I have been taught that of friendship, and I remember the author of the wise saying a friend is another self.

[83:9] I therefore commend to your excellency this property belonging to my friend, as though it were my own.

[83:10] I beg you to consider the misfortunes of the house, and both to grant them consolation for the past, and for the future to make the place more comfortable for them; for it is now left and abandoned on account of the weight of the rates imposed upon it.

[83:11] I will do my best to meet your excellency and converse with you on points of detail.

[84:1] Letter LXXXIV.

[84:2] To the President.

[84:3] 1.

[84:4] You will hardly believe what I am about to write, but it must be written for truth's sake.

[84:5] I have been very anxious to communicate as often as possible with your excellency, but when I got this opportunity of writing a letter I did not at once seize the lucky chance.

[84:6] I hesitated and hung back.

[84:7] What is astonishing is, that when I got what I had been praying for, I did not take it.

[84:8] The reason of this is that I am really ashamed to write to you every time, not out of pure friendship, but with the object of getting something.

[84:9] But then I bethought me (and when you consider it, I do hope you will not think that I communicate with you more for the sake of a bargain than of friendship) that there must be a difference between the way in which one approaches a magistrate and a private man.

[84:10] We do not accost a physician as we do any mere nobody; nor a magistrate as we do a private individual.

[84:11] We try to get some advantage from the skill of the one and the position of the other.

[84:12] Walk in the sun, and your shadow will follow you, whether you will or not.

[84:13] Just so intercourse with the great is followed by an inevitable gain, the succour of the distressed.

[84:14] The first object of my letter is fulfilled in my being able to greet your excellency.

[84:15] Really, if I had no other cause for writing at all, this must be regarded as an excellent topic.

[84:16] Be greeted then, my dear Sir; may you be preserved by all the world while you fill office after office, and succour now some now others by your authority.

[84:17] Such greeting I am wont to make; such greeting is only due to you from all who have had the least experience of your goodness in your administration.

[84:18] 2.

[84:19] Now, after this prayer, hear my supplication on behalf of the poor old man whom the imperial order had exempted from serving in any public capacity; though really I might say that old age anticipated the Emperor in giving him his discharge.

[84:20] You have yourself satisfied the boon conferred on him by the higher authority, at once from respect to natural infirmity, and, I think, from regard to the public interest, lest any harm should come to the state from a man growing imbecile through age.

[84:21] But how, my dear Sir, have you unwittingly dragged him into public life, by ordering his grandson, a child not yet four years old, to be on the roll of the senate? You have done the very same thing as to drag the old man, through his descendant, again into public business.

[84:22] But now, I do implore you, have mercy on both ages, and free both on the ground of what in each case is pitiable.

[84:23] The one never saw father or mother, never knew them, but from his very cradle was deprived of both, and has entered into life by the help of strangers: the other has been preserved so long as to have suffered every kind of calamity.

[84:24] He saw a son's untimely death; he saw a house without successors; now, unless you devise some remedy commensurate with your kindness, he will see the very consolation of his bereavement made an occasion of innumerable troubles, for, I suppose, the little lad will never act as senator, collect tribute, or pay troops; but once again the old man's white hairs must be shamed.

[84:25] Concede a favour in accordance with the law and agreeable to nature; order the boy to be allowed to wait till he come to man's estate, and the old man to await death quietly on his bed.

[84:26] Let others, if they will, urge the pretext of press of business and inevitable necessity.

[84:27] But, even if you are under a press of business, it would not be like you to despise the distressed, to slight the law, or to refuse to yield to the prayers of your friends.

[85:1] Letter LXXXV.

[85:2] That the oath ought not to be taken.

[85:3] It is my invariable custom to protest at every synod and to urge privately in conversation, that oaths about the taxes ought not to be imposed on husbandmen by the collectors.

[85:4] It remains for me to bear witness, on the same matters, in writing, before God and men, that it behoves you to cease from inflicting death upon men's souls, and to devise some other means of exaction, while you let men keep their souls unwounded.

[85:5] I write thus to you, not as though you needed any spoken exhortation (for you have your own immediate inducements to fear the Lord), but that all your dependents may learn from you not to provoke the Holy One, nor let a forbidden sin become a matter of indifference, through faulty familiarity.

[85:6] No possible good can be done them by oaths, with a view to their paying what is exacted from them, and they suffer an undeniable wrong to the soul.

[85:7] For when men become practised in perjury, they no longer put any pressure on themselves to pay, but they think that they have discovered in the oath a means of trickery and an opportunity for delay.

[85:8] If, then, the Lord brings a sharp retribution on the perjured, when the debtors are destroyed by punishment there will be none to answer when summoned.

[85:9] If on the other hand the Lord endures with long suffering, then, as I said before, those who have tried the patience of the Lord despise His goodness.

[85:10] Let them not break the law in vain; let them not whet the wrath of God against them.

[85:11] I have said what I ought.

[85:12] The disobedient will see.

[86:1] Letter LXXXVI.

[86:2] To the Governor.

[86:3] I know that a first and foremost object of your excellency is in every way to support the right; and after that to benefit your friends, and to exert yourself in behalf of those who have fled to your lordship's protection.

[86:4] Both these pleas are combined in the matter before us.

[86:5] The cause is right for which we are pleading; it is dear to me who am numbered among your friends; it is due to those who are invoking the aid of your constancy in their sufferings.

[86:6] The corn, which was all my very, dear brother Dorotheus had for the necessaries of life, has been carried off by some of the authorities at Berisi, entrusted with the management of affairs, driven to this violence of their own accord or by others' instigation.

[86:7] Either way it is an indictable offence.

[86:8] For how does the man whose wickedness is his own do less wrong than he who is the mere minister of other men's wickedness? To the sufferers the loss is the same.

[86:9] I implore you, therefore, that Dorotheus may have his corn returned by the men by whom he has been robbed, and that they may not be allowed to lay the guilt of their outrage on other men's shoulders.

[86:10] If you grant me my request I shall reckon the value of the boon conferred by your excellency in proportion to the necessity of providing one's self with food.

[87:1] Letter LXXXVII.

[87:2] Without address on the same subject.

[87:3] I am astonished that, with you to appeal to, so grave an offence should have been committed against the presbyter as that he should have been deprived of his only means of livelihood.

[87:4] The most serious part of the business is that the perpetrators transfer the guilt of their proceedings to you; while all the while it was your duty not only not to suffer such deeds to be done, but to use all your authority to prevent them in the case of any one, but specially in the case of presbyters, and such presbyters as are in agreement with me, and are walking in the same way of true religion.

[87:5] If then you have any care to give me gratification, see that these matters are set right without delay.

[87:6] For, God helping you, you are able to do this, and greater things than this to whom you will.

[87:7] I have written to the governor of my own country, that, if they refuse to do what is right of their own accord, they may be compelled to do so on pressure from the courts.

[88:1] Letter LXXXVIII.

[88:2] Without address on the subject of the exaction of taxes.

[88:3] Your excellency knows better than any one else the difficulty of getting together the gold furnished by contribution.

[88:4] We have no better witness to our poverty than yourself, for with your great kindness you have felt for us, and, up to the present time, so far as has lain within your power, have borne with us, never departing from your own natural forbearance from any alarm caused by superior authority.

[88:5] Now of the whole sum there is still something wanting, and that must be got in from the contribution which we have recommended to all the town.

[88:6] What I ask is, that you will grant us a little delay, that a reminder may be sent to dwellers in the country, and most of our magistrates are in the country.

[88:7] If it is possible for it to be sent in short of as many pounds as those in which we are still behind-hand, I should be glad if you would so arrange, and the amount shall be sent later.

[88:8] If, however, it is absolutely necessary that the whole sum should be sent in at once, then I repeat my first request that we may be allowed a longer time of grace.

[89:1] Letter LXXXIX.

[89:2] To Meletius, bishop of Antioch.

[89:3] 1.

[89:4] The eagerness of my longing is soothed by the opportunities which the merciful God gives me of saluting your reverence.

[89:5] He Himself is witness of the earnest desire which I have to see your face, and to enjoy your good and soul-refreshing instruction.

[89:6] Now by my reverend and excellent brother Dorotheus, the deacon, who is setting out, first of all I beg you to pray for me that I be no stumbling block to the people, nor hindrance to your petitions to propitiate the Lord.

[89:7] In the second place I would suggest that you would be so good as to make all arrangements through the aforementioned brother; and, if it seems well that a letter should be sent to the Westerns, because it is only right that communication should be made in writing even through our own messenger, that you will dictate the letter.

[89:8] I have met Sabinus the deacon, sent by them, and have written to the bishops in Illyria, Italy, and Gaul, and to some of those who have written privately to myself.

[89:9] For it is right that some one should be sent in the common interests of the Synod, conveying a second letter which I beg you to have written.

[89:10] 2.

[89:11] As to what concerns the right reverend bishop Athanasius, your intelligence is already aware of what I will mention, that it is impossible for anything to be advanced by my letters, or for any desirable objects to be carried out, unless by some means or other he receives communion from you, who at that time postponed it.

[89:12] He is described as being very anxious to unite with me, and to be willing to contribute all he can, but to be sorry that he was sent away without communion, and that the promise still remains unfulfilled.

[89:13] What is going on in the East cannot have failed to reach your reverence's ears, but the aforementioned brother will give you more accurate information by word of mouth.

[89:14] Be so good as to dispatch him directly after Easter, because of his waiting for the answer from Samosata.

[89:15] Look kindly on his zeal strengthen him by your prayers and so dispatch him on this commission.

[90:1] Letter XC.

[90:2] To the holy brethren the bishops of the West.

[90:3] 1.

[90:4] The good God Who ever mixes consolation with affliction has, even now in the midst of my pangs, granted me a certain amount of comfort in the letters which our right honourable father bishop Athanasius has received from you and sent on to me.

[90:5] For they contain evidence of sound faith and proof of your inviolable agreement and concord, showing thus that the shepherds are following in the footsteps of the Fathers and feeding the people of the Lord with knowledge.

[90:6] All this has so much gladdened my heart as to dispel my despondency and to create something like a smile in my soul in the midst of the distressing state of affairs in which we are now placed.

[90:7] The Lord has also extended His consolation to me by means of the reverend deacon Sabinus, my son, who has cheered my soul by giving me an exact narrative of your condition; and from personal experience of his own, will give you clear tidings of ours, that you may, in the first place, aid me in my trouble by earnest and constant prayer to God; and next that you may consent to give such consolation as lies in your power to our afflicted Churches.

[90:8] For here, very honourable brethren, all is in a weak state; the Church has given way before the continuous attacks of her foes, like some bark in mid-ocean buffeted by successive blows of the waves; unless haply there be some quick visitation of the divine mercy.

[90:9] As then we reckon your mutual sympathy and unity an important blessing to ourselves, so do we implore you to pity our dissensions; and not, because we are separated by a great extent of country, to part us from you, but to admit us to the concord of one body, because we are united in the fellowship of the Spirit.

[90:10] 2.

[90:11] Our distresses are notorious, even though we leave them untold, for now their sound has gone out into all the world.

[90:12] The doctrines of the Fathers are despised; apostolic traditions are set at nought; the devices of innovators are in vogue in the Churches; now men are rather contrivers of cunning systems than theologians; the wisdom of this world wins the highest prizes and has rejected the glory of the cross.

[90:13] Shepherds are banished, and in their places are introduced grievous wolves hurrying the flock of Christ.

[90:14] Houses of prayer have none to assemble in them; desert places are full of lamenting crowds.

[90:15] The elders lament when they compare the present with the past.

[90:16] The younger are yet more to be compassionated, for they do not know of what they have been deprived.

[90:17] All this is enough to stir the pity of men who have learnt the love of Christ; but, compared with the actual state of things, words fall very far short.

[90:18] If then there be any consolation of love, any fellowship of the Spirit, any bowels of mercy, be stirred to help us.

[90:19] Be zealous for true religion, and rescue us from this storm.

[90:20] Ever be spoken among us with boldness that famous dogma of the Fathers, which destroys the ill-famed heresy of Arius, and builds up the Churches in the sound doctrine wherein the Son is confessed to be of one substance with the Father, and the Holy Ghost is ranked and worshipped as of equal honour, to the end that through your prayers and co-operation the Lord may grant to us that same boldness for the truth and glorying in the confession of the divine and saving Trinity which He has given you.

[90:21] But the aforenamed deacon will tell you every thing in detail.

[90:22] We have welcomed your apostolic zeal for orthodoxy and have agreed to all that has been canonically done by your reverences.

[91:1] Letter XCI.

[91:2] To Valerianus, Bishop of Illyricum.

[91:3] Thanks be to the Lord, Who has permitted me to see in your unstained life the fruit of primitive love.

[91:4] Far apart as you are in body, you have united yourself to me by writing; you have embraced me with spiritual and holy longing; you have implanted unspeakable affection in my soul.

[91:5] Now I have realized the force of the proverb, "As cold water is to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country".

[91:6] Honoured brother, I really hunger for affection.

[91:7] The cause is not far to seek, for iniquity is multiplied and the love of many has grown cold.

[91:8] For this reason your letter is precious to me, and I am replying by our reverend brother Sabinus.

[91:9] By him I make myself known to you, and beseech you to be watchful in prayers on our behalf, that God may one day grant calm and quiet to the Church here, and rebuke this wind and sea, that so we may be freed from the storm and agitation in which we are now every moment expecting to be submerged.

[91:10] But in these our troubles one great boon has God given us in hearing that you are in exact agreement and unity with one another, and that the doctrines of true religion are preached among you without let or hindrance.

[91:11] For at some time or other, unless the period of this world is not already concluded, and if there yet remain days of human life, it must needs be that by your means the faith must be renewed in the East and that in due season you recompense her for the blessings which she has given you.

[91:12] The sound part among us here, which preserves the true religion of the Fathers, is sore stricken, and the devil in his wiliness has shattered it by many and various subtle assaults.

[91:13] But, by the help of the prayers of you who love the Lord, may the wicked and deceitful heresy of the Arian error be quenched; may the good teaching of the Fathers, who met at Nicaea, shine forth; so that the ascription of glory may be rendered to the blessed Trinity in the terms of the baptism of salvation.

[92:1] Letter XCII.

[92:2] To the Italians and Gauls.

[92:3] 1.

[92:4] To our right godly and holy brethren who are ministering in Italy and Gaul, bishops of like mind with us, we, Meletius, Eusebius, Basil, Bassus, Gregory, Pelagius, Paul, Anthimus, Theodotus, Bithus, Abraamius, Jobinus, Zeno, Theodoretus, Marcianus, Barachus, Abraamius, Libanius, Thalassius, Joseph, Boethus, Iatrius, Theodotus, Eustathius, Barsumas, John, Chosroes, Iosaces, Narses, Maris, Gregory, and Daphnus, send greeting in the Lord.

[92:5] Souls in anguish find some consolation in sending sigh after sigh from the bottom of the heart, and even a tear shed breaks the force of affliction.

[92:6] But sighs and tears give us less consolation than the opportunity of telling our troubles to your love.

[92:7] We are moreover cheered by the better hope that, peradventure, if we announce our troubles to you, we may move you to give us that succour which we have long hoped you would give the Churches in the East, but which we have not yet received; God, Who in His wisdom arranges all things, must have ordained according to the hidden judgments of His righteousness, that we should be tried for a longer time in these temptations.

[92:8] The fame of our condition has travelled to the ends of the earth, and you are not ignorant of it; nor are you without sympathy with brethren of like mind with yourselves, for you are disciples of the apostle, who teaches us that love for our neighbour is the fulfilling of the law.

[92:9] But, as we have said, the just judgment of God, which has ordained that the affliction due to our sins must be fulfilled, has held you back.

[92:10] But when you have learnt all, specially what has not hitherto reached your ears, from our reverend brother the deacon Sabinus, who will be able to narrate in person what is omitted in our letter, we do beseech you to be roused both to zeal for the truth and sympathy for us.

[92:11] We implore you to put on bowels of mercy, to lay aside all hesitation, and to undertake the labour of love, without counting length of way, your own occupations, or any other human interests.

[92:12] 2.

[92:13] It is not only one Church which is in peril, nor yet two or three which have fallen under this terrible storm.

[92:14] The mischief of this heresy spreads almost from the borders of Illyricum to the Thebaid.

[92:15] Its bad seeds were first sown by the infamous Arius; they then took deep root through the labours of many who vigorously cultivated the impiety between his time and ours.

[92:16] Now they have produced their deadly fruit.

[92:17] The doctrines of true religion are overthrown.

[92:18] The laws of the Church are in confusion.

[92:19] The ambition of men, who have no fear of God, rushes into high posts, and exalted office is now publicly known as the prize of impiety.

[92:20] The result is, that the worse a man blasphemes, the fitter the people think him to be a bishop.

[92:21] Clerical dignity is a thing of the past.

[92:22] There is a complete lack of men shepherding the Lord's flock with knowledge.

[92:23] Ambitious men are constantly throwing away the provision for the poor on their own enjoyment and the distribution of gifts.

[92:24] There is no precise knowledge of canons.

[92:25] There is complete immunity in sinning; for when men have been placed in office by the favour of men, they are obliged to return the favour by continually showing indulgence to offenders.

[92:26] Just judgment is a thing of the past; and everyone walks according to his heart's desire.

[92:27] Vice knows no bounds; the people know no restraint.

[92:28] Men in authority are afraid to speak, for those who have reached power by human interest are the slaves of those to whom they owe their advancement.

[92:29] And now the very vindication of orthodoxy is looked upon in some quarters as an opportunity for mutual attack; and men conceal their private ill-will and pretend that their hostility is all for the sake of the truth.

[92:30] Others, afraid of being convicted of disgraceful crimes, madden the people into fratricidal quarrels, that their own doings may be unnoticed in the general distress.

[92:31] Hence the war admits of no truce, for the doers of ill deeds are afraid of a peace, as being likely to lift the veil from their secret infamy.

[92:32] All the while unbelievers laugh; men of weak faith are shaken; faith is uncertain; souls are drenched in ignorance, because adulterators of the word imitate the truth.

[92:33] The mouths of true believers are dumb, while every blasphemous tongue wags free; holy things are trodden under foot; the better laity shun the churches as schools of impiety; and lift their hands in the deserts with sighs and tears to their Lord in heaven.

[92:34] Even you must have heard what is going on in most of our cities, how our people with wives and children and even our old men stream out before the walls, and offer their prayers in the open air, putting up with all the inconvenience of the weather with great patience, and waiting for help from the Lord.

[92:35] 3.

[92:36] What lamentation can match these woes? What springs of tears are sufficient for them? While, then, some men do seem to stand, while yet a trace of the old state of things is left, before utter shipwreck comes upon the Churches, hasten to us, hasten to us now, true brothers, we implore you; on our knees we implore you, hold out a helping hand.

[92:37] May your brotherly bowels be moved toward us; may tears of sympathy flow; do not see, unmoved, half the empire swallowed up by error; do not let the light of the faith be put out in the place where it shone first.

[92:38] By what action you can then help matters, and how you are to show sympathy for the afflicted, you do not want to be told by us; the Holy Ghost will suggest to you.

[92:39] But unquestionably, if the survivors are to be saved, there is need of prompt action, and of the arrival of a considerable number of brethren, that those who visit us may complete the number of the synod, in order that they may have weight in effecting a reform, not merely from the dignity of those whose emissaries they are, but also from their own number: thus they will restore the creed drawn up by our fathers at Nicaea, proscribe the heresy, and, by bringing into agreement all who are of one mind, speak peace to the Churches.

[92:40] For the saddest thing about it all is that the sound part is divided against itself, and the troubles we are suffering are like those which once befel Jerusalem when Vespasian was besieging it.

[92:41] The Jews of that time were at once beset by foes without and consumed by the internal sedition of their own people.

[92:42] In our case, too, in addition to the open attack of the heretics, the Churches are reduced to utter helplessness by the war raging among those who are supposed to be orthodox.

[92:43] For all these reasons we do indeed desire your help, that, for the future all who confess the apostolic faith may put an end to the schisms which they have unhappily devised, and be reduced for the future to the authority of the Church; that so, once more, the body of Christ may be complete, restored to integrity with all its members.

[92:44] Thus we shall not only praise the blessings of others, which is all we can do now, but see our own Churches once more restored to their pristine boast of orthodoxy.

[92:45] For, truly, the boon given you by the Lord is fit subject for the highest congratulation, your power of discernment between the spurious and the genuine and pure, and your preaching the faith of the Fathers without any dissimulation.

[92:46] That faith we have received; that faith we know is stamped with the marks of the Apostles; to that faith we assent, as well as to all that was canonically and lawfully promulgated in the Synodical Letter.

[93:1] Letter XCIII.

[93:2] To the Patrician Caesaria, concerning Communion.

[93:3] It is good and beneficial to communicate every day, and to partake of the holy body and blood of Christ.

[93:4] For He distinctly says, "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life".

[93:5] And who doubts that to share frequently in life, is the same thing as to have manifold life.

[93:6] I, indeed, communicate four times a week, on the Lord's day, on Wednesday, on Friday, and on the Sabbath, and on the other days if there is a commemoration of any Saint.

[93:7] It is needless to point out that for anyone in times of persecution to be compelled to take the communion in his own hand without the presence of a priest or minister is not a serious offence, as long custom sanctions this practice from the facts themselves.

[93:8] All the solitaries in the desert, where there is no priest, take the communion themselves, keeping communion at home.

[93:9] And at Alexandria and in Egypt, each one of the laity, for the most part, keeps the communion, at his own house, and participates in it when he likes.

[93:10] For when once the priest has completed the offering, and given it, the recipient, participating in it each time as entire, is bound to believe that he properly takes and receives it from the giver.

[93:11] And even in the church, when the priest gives the portion, the recipient takes it with complete power over it, and so lifts it to his lips with his own hand.

[93:12] It has the same validity whether one portion or several portions are received from the priest at the same time.

[94:1] Letter XCIV.

[94:2] To Elias, Governor of the Province.

[94:3] I too have been very anxious to meet your excellency, lest by my failure to do so I might come off worse than my accusers; but bodily sickness has prevented me, attacking me even more seriously than usual, and so I am perforce reduced to address you by letter.

[94:4] When, not long ago, most excellent sir, I had the pleasure of meeting your excellency, I was anxious to communicate with your wisdom about all my affairs; and I was also anxious to address you on behalf of the Churches, that no ground might be left for future calumnies.

[94:5] But I restrained myself, thinking it altogether superfluous and importunate to add troubles outside his own necessary business to a man charged with so many responsibilities.

[94:6] At the same time (for the truth shall be told) I did shrink from being driven to wound your soul by our mutual recriminations, when it ought in pure devotion to God to reap the perfect reward of piety.

[94:7] For really, if I attract your attention to me, I shall leave you but scant leisure for your public duties; shall act something like a man overloading with additional luggage some boatmen managing a new boat in very rough water, when all the while he ought to lessen the cargo and do his best to lighten the craft.

[94:8] For this very reason, I think, our great Emperor, after seeing how fully occupied I am, leaves me to manage the Churches by myself.

[94:9] Now I should like those who are besieging your impartial ears to be asked what harm the government suffers from me? What depreciation is suffered by any public interests, be they small or great, by my administration of the Churches? Still, possibly, it might be urged that I have done damage to the government by erecting a magnificently appointed church to God, and round it a dwelling house, one liberally assigned to the bishop, and others underneath, allotted to the officers of the Church in order, the use of both being open to you of the magistracy and your escort.

[94:10] But to whom do we do any harm by building a place of entertainment for strangers, both for those who are on a journey and for those who require medical treatment on account of sickness, and so establishing a means of giving these men the comfort they want, physicians, doctors, means of conveyance, and escort? All these men must learn such occupations as are necessary to life and have been found essential to a respectable career; they must also have buildings suitable for their employments, all of which are an honour to the place, and, as their reputation is credited to our governor, confer glory on him.

[94:11] Not indeed that for this reason you were unwillingly induced to accept the responsibility of ruling us, for you alone are sufficient by your high qualities to restore our ruins, to people deserted districts and turn wildernesses into towns.

[94:12] Would it be better to harrass and annoy, or to honour and reverence an associate in the discharge of these duties? Do not think, most excellent sir, that what I say is mere words.

[94:13] We have already, in the meanwhile, begun providing material.

[94:14] So much for our defence, before our ruler.

[94:15] As to what is to be said in answer to the charges of our accusers, to a Christian and to a friend who cares for my opinion, I must now say no more; the subject is too long for a letter, and cannot, besides, be safely committed to writing.

[94:16] But lest, before we have an opportunity of meeting, you are driven by the inducement of some men's calumnies to give up any of your good will towards me, do as Alexander did.

[94:17] The story is, as you remember, that, when one of his friends was being calumniated, he left one ear open to the slanderer, and carefully closed the other with his hand, with the object of showing that he whose duty is to judge ought not to be easily and wholly given over to the first occupants of his attention, but should keep half his hearing open for the defence of the absent.

[95:1] Letter XCV.

[95:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[95:3] I had written some while since to your reverence about our meeting one another and other subjects, but I was disappointed at my letter not reaching your excellency, for after the blessed deacon Theophrastus had taken charge of the letter, on my setting out on an unavoidable journey, he did not convey it to your reverence, because he was seized by the sickness of which he died.

[95:4] Hence it happened that I was so late in writing, that, the time being now so exceedingly short, I did not look for there being much use in this letter.

[95:5] The godly bishop Meletius and Theodotus had strongly urged me to visit them, representing that a meeting would be a proof of affection, and being wishful of remedying the troubles which are at present a cause of anxiety.

[95:6] They had appointed, as a time for our meeting, the middle of the approaching month of June, and for the place, Phargamus, a spot famous for martyr's glory and for the large number of people attending the synod there every year.

[95:7] Directly I returned and heard of the death of the blessed deacon, and that my letter was lying useless at home, I felt that I must not be idle, because thirty-three days were still remaining up to the appointed time, and so I hurriedly sent the letter to the very reverend Eustathius, my fellow minister, with the object of its being sent on by him to your reverence and of getting an answer without delay.

[95:8] If, then, it is possible and agreeable to you to come, I will come too.

[95:9] If not, I, God willing, will pay the debt of meeting due from last year: unless haply some hindrance for my sins comes in the way again, in which case I must put off my meeting with the bishops to another time.

[96:1] Letter XCVI.

[96:2] To Sophronius, the master.

[96:3] Who ever loved his city, honouring with filial love the place which gave him birth and nurture, as you do; praying for the whole city together, and for every one in it individually, and not merely praying but confirming your prayers by your own means? For this you are able to effect by God's help, and long, good man that you are, may you be able so to do.

[96:4] Nevertheless in your time our city has enjoyed but a brief dream of prosperity, in being committed to the charge of one the like of whom, according to the students of our oldest annals, never sat in the praefectorial chair.

[96:5] But now the city has suddenly lost his services, through the wickedness of men who have found a ground of attack in his very liberality and impartiality, and, without the knowledge of your excellency, have made up calumnies against him.

[96:6] There is therefore universal depression among us at the loss of a governor with unique capacity for raising our dejected community, a true guardian of justice, accessible to the wronged, a terror to law breakers, of like behaviour to rich and poor, and, what is most important, one who has restored the interests of Christians to their old place of honour.

[96:7] That he was, of all men that I know, the most incapable of being bribed, and never did any one an unfair favour, I have passed by as a small point in comparison with his other virtues.

[96:8] I am indeed testifying to all this too late, like men who sing dirges to console themselves when they can get no practical relief.

[96:9] Yet, it is not useless that his memory should remain in your generous heart, and that you should be grateful to him as a benefactor of your native place.

[96:10] Should any of those who feel a grudge against him, for not sacrificing justice to their interests, attack him, it will be well for you to defend and protect him.

[96:11] Thus you will make it clear to all that you count his interests yours, and think it quite a sufficient reason for this your close association with him that his record should be so unimpeachable, and his administration so remarkable in view of the time.

[96:12] For what any other man would not be able to affect in many years has been quickly accomplished by him.

[96:13] It will be a great favour to me, and a comfort under the circumstances, if you will recommend him to the Emperor, and dispel the calumnious charges brought against him.

[96:14] Believe me that I am speaking here not for myself alone, but for the whole community, and that it is our unanimous prayer that he may reap some benefit from your excellency's aid.

[97:1] Letter XCVII.

[97:2] To the Senate of Tyana.

[97:3] The Lord, Who reveals hidden things, and makes manifest the counsels of men's hearts, has given even to the lowly knowledge of devices apparently hard to be understood.

[97:4] Nothing has escaped my notice, nor has any single action been unknown.

[97:5] Nevertheless I neither see nor hear anything but the peace of God and all that pertains to it.

[97:6] Others may be great and powerful and self-confident, but I am nothing and worth nothing, and so I could never take upon myself so much as to think myself able to manage matters without support.

[97:7] I know perfectly well that I stand more in need of the succour of each of the brethren than one hand does of the other.

[97:8] Truly, from our own bodily constitution, the Lord has taught us the necessity of fellowship.

[97:9] When I look to these my limbs and see that no out of them is self-sufficient, how can I reckon myself competent to discharge the duties of life? One foot could not walk securely without the support of the other; one eye could not see well, were it not for the alliance of the other and for its being able to look at objects in conjunction with it.

[97:10] Hearing is more exact when sound is received through both channels, and the grasp is made firmer by the fellowship of the fingers.

[97:11] In a word, of all that is done by nature and by the will, I see nothing done without the concord of fellow forces.

[97:12] Even prayer, when it is not united prayer, loses its natural strength and the Lord has told us that He will be in the midst where two or three call on Him in concord.

[97:13] The Lord Himself undertook the economy, that by the blood of His cross He might make peace between things in earth and things in heaven.

[97:14] For all these reasons then, I pray that I may for my remaining days remain in peace; in peace I ask that it may be my lot to fall asleep.

[97:15] For peace's sake there is no trouble that I will not undertake, no act, no word of humility, that I will shrink from; I will reckon no length of journey, I will undergo any inconvenience, if only I may be rewarded by being able to make peace.

[97:16] If I am followed by any one in this direction, it is well, and my prayers are answered; but if the result is different I shall not recede from my determination.

[97:17] Every one will receive the fruit of his own works in the day of retribution.

[98:1] Letter XCVIII.

[98:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[98:3] 1.

[98:4] After receiving the letter of your holiness, in which you said you would not come, I was most anxious to set out for Nicopolis, but I have grown weaker in my wish and have remembered all my infirmity.

[98:5] I bethought me, too, of the lack of seriousness in the conduct of those who invited me.

[98:6] They gave me a casual invitation by the hands of our reverend brother Hellenius, the surveyor of customs at Nazianzus, but they never took the trouble to send a messenger to remind me, or any one to escort me.

[98:7] As, for my sins, I was an object of suspicion to them, I shrank from sullying the brightness of their meeting by my presence.

[98:8] In company with your excellency I do not shrink from stripping for even serious trials of strength; but apart from you I feel myself hardly equal even to looking at every day troubles.

[98:9] Since, then, my meeting with them was intended to be about Church affairs, I let the time of the festival go by, and put off the meeting to a period of rest and freedom from distraction, and have decided to go to Nicopolis to discuss the needs of the Churches with the godly bishop Meletius, in case he should decline to go to Samosata.

[98:10] If he agrees, I shall hasten to meet him, provided this is made clear to me by both of you, by him in reply to me (for I have written), and by your reverence.

[98:11] 2.

[98:12] We were to have met the bishops of Cappadocia Secunda, who, directly they were ranked under another prefecture, suddenly got the idea that they were made foreigners and strangers to me.

[98:13] They ignored me, as though they had never been under my jurisdiction, and had nothing to do with me.

[98:14] I was expecting too a second meeting with the reverend bishop Eustathius, which actually took place.

[98:15] For on account of the cry raised by many against him that he was injuring the faith, I met him, and found, by God's grace, that he was heartily following all orthodoxy.

[98:16] By the fault of the very men who ought to have conveyed my letter, that of the bishop was not transmitted to your excellency, and, harassed as I was by a multitude of cares, it escaped my memory.

[98:17] I, too, was anxious that our brother Gregory should have the government of a Church commensurate with his abilities; and that would have been the whole Church under the sun gathered into one place.

[98:18] But, as this is impossible, let him be a bishop, not deriving dignity from his see, but conferring dignity on his see by himself.

[98:19] For it is the part of a really great man not only to be sufficient for great things, but by his own influence to make small things great.

[98:20] But what is to be done to Palmatius, who, after so many exhortations of the brethren, still helps Maximus in his persecutions? Even now they do not hesitate to write to him.

[98:21] They are prevented from coming themselves by bodily weakness and their own occupations.

[98:22] Believe me, very godly Father, our own affairs are much in need of your presence, and yet once more you must put your honourable old age in motion, that you may give your support to Cappadocia, which is now tottering and in danger of falling.

[99:1] Letter XCIX.

[99:2] To Count Terentius.

[99:3] I have had every desire and have really done my best to obey, if only in part, the imperial order and the friendly letter of your excellency.

[99:4] I am sure that your every word and every thought are full of good intentions and right sentiments.

[99:5] But I have not been permitted to show my ready concurrence by practical action.

[99:6] The truest cause is my sins, which always rise before me and always hamper my steps.

[99:7] Then, again, there is the alienation of the bishop who had been appointed to cooperate with me, why, I know not; but my right reverend brother Theodotus, who promised from the beginning to act with me, had cordially invited me from Getasa to Nicopolis.

[99:8] When however he saw me in the town, he was so shocked at me, and so afraid of my sins, that he could not bear to take me either to morning or evening prayer.

[99:9] In this he acted quite justly so far as my deserts go, and quite as befits my course of life, but not in a manner likely to promote the interests of the Churches.

[99:10] His alleged reason was that I had admitted the very reverend brother Eustathius to communion.

[99:11] What I have done is as follows.

[99:12] When invited to a meeting held by our brother Theodotus, and wishful, for love's sake, to obey the summons, that I might not make the gathering fruitless and vain, I was anxious to hold communication with the aforementioned brother Eustathius.

[99:13] I put before him the accusations concerning the faith, advanced against him by our brother Theodotus, and I asked him, if he followed the right faith, to make it plain to me, that I might communicate with him; if he were of another mind he must know plainly that I should be separated from him.

[99:14] We had much conversation on the subject, and all that day was spent in its examination; when evening came on we separated without arriving at any definite conclusion.

[99:15] On the morrow, we had another sitting in the morning and discussed the same points, with the addition of our brother Poemenius, the presbyter of Sebasteia, who vehemently pressed the argument against me.

[99:16] Point by point I cleared up the questions on which he seemed to be accusing me, and brought them to agree to my propositions.

[99:17] The result was, that, by the grace of the Lord, we were found to be in mutual agreement, even on the most minute particulars.

[99:18] So about the ninth hour, after thanking God for granting us to think and say the same thing, we rose up to go to prayer.

[99:19] In addition to this I ought to have got some written statement from him, so that his assent might be made known to his opponents and the proof of his opinion might be sufficient for the rest.

[99:20] But I was myself anxious, with the desire for great exactitude, to meet my brother Theodotus, to get a written statement of the faith from him, and to propose it to Eustathius; that so both objects might be obtained at once, the confession of the right faith by Eustathius and the complete satisfaction of Theodotus and his friends, and they would have no ground for objection after the acceptance of their own propositions.

[99:21] But Theodotus, before learning why we were met and what had been the result of our intercourse, decided not to allow us to take part in the meeting.

[99:22] So midway on our journey we set out back again, disappointed that our efforts for the peace of the Churches had been counteracted.

[99:23] 3.

[99:24] After this, when I was compelled to undertake a journey into Armenia, knowing the man's character, and with the view both of making my own defence before a competent witness, for what had taken place and of satisfying him, I travelled to Getasa, into the territory of the very godly bishop Meletius, the aforementioned Theodotus being with me; and while there, on being accused by him of my communication with Eustathius, I told him that the result of our intercourse was my finding Eustathius to be in all things in agreement with myself.

[99:25] Then he persisted that Eustathius, after leaving me, had denied this and asseverated to his own disciples that he had never come to any agreement with me about the faith.

[99:26] I, therefore, combated this statement; and see, O most excellent man, if the answer I made was not most fair and most complete.

[99:27] I am convinced, I said, judging from the character of Eustathius, that he cannot thus lightly be turning from one direction to another, now confessing now denying what he said; that a man, shunning a lie, even in any little matter, as an awful sin, is not likely to choose to run counter to the truth in matters of such vast importance and so generally notorious: but if what is reported among you turns out to be true, he must be confronted with a written statement containing the complete exposition of the right faith; then, if I find him ready to agree in writing, I shall continue in communion with him; but, if I find that he shrinks from the test, I shall renounce all intercourse with him.

[99:28] The bishop Meletius agreed to these arguments, and the brother Diodorus the presbyter, who was present, and then the right reverend brother Theodotus, assented, and invited me to go to Nicopolis, both to visit the Church there, and to keep him company as far as Satala.

[99:29] But he left me at Getasa, and, when I reached Nicopolis, forgetting all that he heard from me, and the agreement he had made with me, dismissed me, disgraced by the insults and dishonours which I have mentioned.

[99:30] 4.

[99:31] How, then, right honourable sir, was it possible for me to perform any of the injunctions laid on me, and to provide bishops for Armenia? How could I act, when the sharer of my responsibilities was thus disposed towards me,—the very man by whose aid I was expecting to be able to find suitable persons, because of his having in his district reverend and learned men, skilled in speech, and acquainted with the other peculiarities of the nation? I know their names, but I shall refrain from mentioning them, lest there arise any hindrance to the interests of Armenia being served at some future time.

[99:32] Now, after getting as far as Satala in such a state of health, I seemed to settle the rest by the grace of God.

[99:33] I made peace between the Armenian bishops, and made them a suitable address, urging them to put away their customary indifference, and resume their ancient zeal in the Lord's cause.

[99:34] Moreover, I delivered them rules as to how it behoved them to give heed to iniquities generally practised in Armenia.

[99:35] I further accepted a decision of the Church of Satala, asking that a bishop might be given them through me.

[99:36] I was also careful to inquire into the calumnies promulgated against our brother Cyril, the Armenian bishop, and by God's grace I have found them to be started by the lying slanders of his enemies.

[99:37] This they confessed to me.

[99:38] And I seemed to some extent to reconcile the people to him, so that they avoid communion with him no more.

[99:39] Small achievements these, maybe, and not worth much, but in consequence of the mutual discord caused by the wiles of the devil, it was impossible for me to effect more.

[99:40] Even this much I ought not to have said, so as not to seem to be publishing my own disgrace.

[99:41] But as I could not plead my cause before your excellency in any other way, I was under the necessity of telling you the entire truth.

[100:1] Letter C.

[100:2] To Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata.

[100:3] When I saw your affectionate letter, in the country bordering on Armenia, it was like a lighted torch held up at a distance to mariners at sea, especially if the sea happen to be agitated by the wind.

[100:4] Your reverence's letter was of itself a pleasant one, and full of comfort; but its natural charm was very much enhanced by the time of its arrival, a time so painful to me, that I hardly know how to describe it, after once making up my mind to forget its troubles.

[100:5] However, my deacon will give you a full account.

[100:6] My bodily strength completely failed me, so that I was not even able to bear the slightest movement without pain.

[100:7] Nevertheless I do pray that, by the aid of your prayers, my own longing may be fulfilled; although my journey has caused me great difficulties, in consequence of the affairs of my own Church having been neglected through its occupying such a long time.

[100:8] But if, while I yet live, God grants me to see your reverence in my Church, then truly I shall have good hope, even for the future, that I am not wholly excluded from the gifts of God.

[100:9] If it be possible, I beg that this meeting between us may take place at the Synod which we hold every year, in memory of the blessed martyr Eupsychius, now about to be held on the 7th of September.

[100:10] I am compassed with anxieties which demand your help and sympathy, both in the matter of the appointment of bishops and in the consideration of the trouble caused me by the simplicity of Gregory of Nyssa, who is summoning a Synod at Ancyra and leaving nothing undone to counteract me.

[101:1] Letter CI.

[101:2] Consolatory.

[101:3] This is my first letter to you, and I could have prayed that its subject were a brighter one.

[101:4] Had it been so, things would have fallen out as I desire, for it is my wish that the life of all those who are purposed to live in true religion should be happily spent.

[101:5] But the Lord, Who ordains our course in accordance with His ineffable wisdom, has arranged that all these things should come about for the advantage of our souls, whereby He has, on the one hand, made your life sorrowful, and on the other, roused the sympathy of one who, like myself, is united to you in godly love.

[101:6] Therefore on my learning from my brothers what has befallen you it has seemed to me that I could not but give you such comfort as I can.

[101:7] Had it indeed been possible to me to travel to the place in which you are now living I would have made every effort to do so.

[101:8] But my bad health and the present business which occupies me have caused this very journey, which I have undertaken, to be injurious to the interests of my Church.

[101:9] I have, therefore, determined to address your excellency in writing, to remind you that these afflictions are not sent by the Lord, Who rules us, to the servants of God to no purpose, but as a test of the genuineness of our love to the divine Creator.

[101:10] Just as athletes win crowns by their struggles in the arena, so are Christians brought to perfection by the trial of their temptations, if only we learn to accept what is sent us by the Lord with becoming patience, with all thanksgiving.

[101:11] All things are ordained by the Lord's love.

[101:12] We must not accept anything that befalls us as grievous, even if, for the present, it affects our weakness.

[101:13] We are ignorant, peradventure, of the reasons why each thing that happens to us is sent to us as a blessing by the Lord but we ought to be convinced that all that happens to us is for our good, either for the reward of our patience, or for the soul which we have received, lest, by lingering too long in this life, it be filled with the wickedness to be found in this world.

[101:14] If the hope of Christians is limited to this life, it might rightly have been reckoned a bitter lot to be prematurely parted from the body; but if, to them that love God, the sundering of the soul from these bodily fetters is the beginning of our real life, why do we grieve like them which have no hope? Be comforted then, and do not fall under your troubles, but show that you are superior to them and can rise above them.

[102:1] Letter CII.

[102:2] To the citizens of Satala.

[102:3] Moved by your importunity and that of all your people, I have undertaken the charge of your Church, and have promised before the Lord that I will be wanting to you in nothing which is within my power.

[102:4] So I have been compelled, as it is written, to touch as it were the apple of my eye.

[102:5] Thus the high honour in which I hold you has suffered me to remember neither relationship, nor the intimacy which I have had from my boyhood with the person in question, as making a stronger demand on me than your request.

[102:6] I have forgotten all the private considerations which made him near and dear to me, making no account of the sighs which will be heaved by all my people on being deprived of his rule, none of the tears of all his kindred; nor have I taken to heart the affliction of his aged mother, who is supported by his aid alone.

[102:7] All these considerations, great and many as they are, I have put aside, keeping only in view the one object of giving your Church the blessing of the rule of such a man, and of aiding her, now distressed as she is, at being so long without a head, and needing great and powerful support to be enabled to rise again.

[102:8] So much for what concerns myself.

[102:9] Now, on the other hand, I ask you not to fall short of the hope which I have entertained and of the promises which I have made him, that I have sent him to close friends.

[102:10] I ask every one of you to try to surpass the rest in love and affection to him.

[102:11] I entreat you to show this laudable rivalry, and to comfort his heart by the greatness of your attentions to him, that he may forget his own home, forget his kinsfolk, and forget a people so dependent on his rule, like a child weaned from his mother's breast.

[102:12] I have despatched Nicias beforehand to explain everything to your excellencies, and that you may fix a day to keep the feast and give thanks to the Lord, Who has granted the fulfilment of your prayer.

[103:1] Letter CIII.

[103:2] To the people of Satala.

[103:3] The Lord has answered the prayer of His people and has given them, by my humble instrumentality, a shepherd worthy of the name; not one making traffic of the word, as many do, but competent to give full satisfaction to you, who love orthodoxy of doctrine, and have accepted a life agreeable to the Lord's commands, in the name of the Lord, Who has filled him with His own spiritual graces.

[104:1] Letter CIV.

[104:2] To the prefect Modestus.

[104:3] Merely to write to so great a man, even though there be no other reason, must be esteemed a great honour.

[104:4] For communication with personages of high distinction confers glory upon all to whom it is permitted.

[104:5] My supplication, however, is one which I am driven by necessity to make to your excellency, in my great distress at the condition of my whole country.

[104:6] Bear with me, I beg you, kindly and in accordance with your own characters and reach a helping hand to my country, now beaten to the knee.

[104:7] The immediate object of my entreaty is as follows.

[104:8] By the old census, the clergy of God, presbyters and deacons, were left exempt.

[104:9] The recent registrars, however, without any authority from your lordship, have enrolled them, except that in some cases a few were granted immunity on the score of age.

[104:10] I ask, then, that you will leave us this memorial of your beneficence, to preserve through all coming time your good fame; that in accordance with the old law the clergy be exempt from contribution.

[104:11] I do not ask the remission to be conceded personally and individually to those who are now included, in which case the grace will pass to their successors, who may not always be worthy of the sacred ministry.

[104:12] I would suggest that some general concession be made to the clergy, according to the form in the open register, so that the exemption may be given in each place to ministers by the rulers of the Church.

[104:13] This boon is sure to bring undying glory to your excellency for your good deeds, and will cause many to pray for the imperial house.

[104:14] It will also really be profitable to the government, if we afford the relief of exemption, not generally to all the clergy, but to those who from time to time are in distress.

[104:15] This, as any one who chooses may know, is the course we actually pursue when we are at liberty.

[105:1] Letter CV.

[105:2] To the deaconesses, the daughters of Count Terentius.

[105:3] On coming to Samosata I expected to have the pleasure of meeting your excellencies, and when I was disappointed I could not easily bear it.

[105:4] When, I said, will it be possible for me to be in your neighbourhood again? When will it be agreeable to you to come into mine? All this, however, must be left to the Lord's will.

[105:5] As to the present, when I found that my son Sophronius was setting out to you, I gladly delivered him this letter, to convey you my salutation, and to tell you how, by God's grace, I do not cease to remember you, and to thank the Lord on your behalf, in that you are goodly scions of a goodly stock, fruitful in good works, and verily like lilies among thorns.

[105:6] Surrounded as you are by the terrible perversity of them that are corrupting the word of truth, you do not give in to their wiles; you have not abandoned the apostolic proclamation of faith, you have not gone over to the successful novelty of the day.

[105:7] Is not this cause of deep thankfulness to God? Shall not this rightly bring you great renown? You have professed your faith in Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

[105:8] Do not abandon this deposit; the Father—origin of all; the Son—Only begotten, begotten of Him, very God, Perfect of Perfect, living image, shewing the whole Father in Himself; the Holy Ghost, having His subsistence of God, the fount of holiness, power that gives life, grace that maketh perfect, through Whom man is adopted, and the mortal made immortal, conjoined with Father and Son in all things in glory and eternity, in power and kingdom, in sovereignty and godhead; as is testified by the tradition of the baptism of salvation.

[105:9] But all who maintain that either Son or Spirit is a creature, or absolutely reduce the Spirit to ministerial and servile rank, are far removed from the truth.

[105:10] Flee their communion.

[105:11] Turn away from their teaching.

[105:12] They are destructive to souls.

[105:13] If ever the Lord grant us to meet, I will discourse to you further concerning the faith, to the end that you may perceive at once the power of the truth and the rottenness of heresy by Scriptural proof.

[106:1] Letter CVI.

[106:2] To a soldier.

[106:3] I have many reasons for thanking God for mercies vouchsafed to me in my journey, but I count no blessing greater than the knowledge of your excellency, which has been permitted me by our good Lord's mercy.

[106:4] I have learnt to know one who proves that even in a soldier's life it is possible to preserve the perfection of love to God, and that we must mark a Christian not by the style of his dress, but by the disposition of his soul.

[106:5] It was a great delight to me to meet you; and now, whenever I remember you, I feel very glad.

[106:6] Play the man; be strong; strive to nourish and multiply love to God, that there may be given you by Him yet greater boons of blessing.

[106:7] I need no further proof that you remember me; I have evidence in what you have done.

[107:1] Letter CVII.

[107:2] To the Widow Julitta.

[107:3] I was grieved to find on reading your ladyship's letter that you are involved in the same difficulties.

[107:4] What is to be done to men who show such a shifty character, saying now one thing now another and never abiding in the same pledges? If, after the promises made in my presence, and in that of the ex-prefect, he now tries to shorten the time of grace as though nothing had been said, he does seem to have lost, as far as I am concerned, all sense of shame.

[107:5] Nevertheless I wrote to him, rebuking him, and reminding him of his promises.

[107:6] I wrote also to Helladius, who is of the household of the prefect, that information might be given through him about your affairs.

[107:7] I hesitated myself to make so free with an officer of such importance, on account of my never having yet written to him about my own private affairs and my fearing some adverse decision from him, great men, as you know, being easily annoyed about such matters.

[107:8] If, however, any good is to be done in the matter, it will be through Helladius, an excellent man, well disposed towards me, fearing God, and having perfectly free access to the prefect.

[107:9] The Holy One is able to deliver you from all affliction, if only truly and sincerely we fix all our hope on Him.

[108:1] Letter CVIII.

[108:2] To the guardian of the heirs of Julitta.

[108:3] I am very much astonished to hear that, after the kind promises which you made and which were only such as might be expected from your generous character, you have now forgotten them and are putting violent and stern pressure on our sister.

[108:4] What to think, under the circumstances, I really do not know.

[108:5] I know from many who have experienced your liberality, and bear testimony to it, how great it is; and I remember the promises which you made before me and the ex-prefect.

[108:6] You said that you were naming a shorter time in writing, but that you would grant a longer term of grace, from your wish to meet the necessities of the case, and do a favour to the widow, who is now compelled to pay out of her substance such a large sum of money at once.

[108:7] What is the cause of this change I cannot imagine.

[108:8] However, whatever it is, I beg you to be mindful of your own generous character, and to look to the Lord Who requites good deeds.

[108:9] I beg you to grant the time of remission, which you promised at the outset, that they may be able to sell their property and discharge the debt.

[108:10] I perfectly well remember that you promised, if you received the sum agreed on, to restore to the widow all the stipulated documents, as well those which had been executed before the magistrates as the private papers.

[108:11] I do beg you then, honour me and win great blessing for yourself from the Lord.

[108:12] Remember your own promises, recognizing that you are human and must yourself look for that time when you will need God's help.

[108:13] Do not shut yourself off from that help by your present severity; but, by showing all kindness and clemency to the afflicted, attract God's pity to yourself.

[109:1] Letter CIX.

[109:2] To the Count Helladius.

[109:3] I shrink from troubling your good nature, on account of the greatness of your influence, for fear of seeming to make an unwarrantable use of your friendship; however, the necessity of the case prevents my holding my peace.

[109:4] Our sister, who is a relative of mine, and now in the sorrowful position of a widow, has to look after the affairs of her orphan boy.

[109:5] On seeing her above measure oppressed by intolerable responsibilities, I felt great compassion for her, and, feeling deeply on the subject, I have hastened to invoke your aid, in order that you may, if possible, deign to support the messenger whom she has sent, to the end that when she has paid what she promised in person in my presence, she may be freed from any further pressure.

[109:6] She had agreed that she should be relieved from the interest on payment of the capital.

[109:7] Now, however, those who are looking after the affairs of her heirs are trying to exact the payment of the interest as well as that of the capital.

[109:8] The Lord, you know, makes the care of widows and orphans His own, and so do you strive to use your best endeavours in this matter, in the hope of the recompense which God Himself will give you.

[109:9] I cannot help thinking that, when our admirable and kindly prefect has heard of the discharge of the capital, he will feel for this afflicted and unhappy house now stricken to the knee, and no longer able to cope with the injuries inflicted upon it.

[109:10] Pardon, then, the necessity which compels me to intrude upon you; and give your help in this matter, in proportion to the power which Christ has given you, good and true man as you are, and using your talents for the best.

[110:1] Letter CX.

[110:2] To the prefect Modestus.

[110:3] In kindly condescending to come down to me you give me great honour and allow me great freedom; and these in like, aye and in greater, measure, I pray that your lordship may receive from our good Master during the whole of your life.

[110:4] I have long wanted to write to you and to receive honour at your hands, but respect for your great dignity has restrained me, and I have been careful lest I should ever seem to abuse the liberty conceded to me.

[110:5] Now, however, I am forced to take courage, not only by the fact of my having received permission from your incomparable excellency to write, but also by the necessity of the distressed.

[110:6] If, then, prayers of even the small are of any avail with the great, be moved, most excellent sir, of your good will to grant relief to a rural population now in pitiable case, and give orders that the tax of iron, paid by the inhabitants of iron-producing Taurus, may be made such as it is possible to pay.

[110:7] Grant this, lest they be crushed once for all, instead of being of lasting service to the state.

[110:8] I am sure that your admirable benevolence will see that this is done.

[111:1] Letter CXI.

[111:2] To Modestus, the prefect.

[111:3] Under any ordinary circumstances I should have lacked courage to intrude upon your excellency, for I know how to gauge my own importance and to recognise dignities.

[111:4] But now that I have seen a friend in a distressing position at having been summoned before you, I have ventured to give him this letter.

[111:5] I hope that by using it, as a kind of propitiatory symbol, he may meet with merciful consideration.

[111:6] Truly, although I am of no account, moderation itself may be able to conciliate the most merciful of prefects, and to win pardon for me.

[111:7] Thus if my friend has done no wrong, he may be saved by the mere force of truth; if he has erred, he may be forgiven through my entreaty.

[111:8] How we are situated here no one knows better than yourself, for you discern the weak parts in each man and rule all with your admirable forethought.

[112:1] Letter CXII.

[112:2] To Andronicus, a general.

[112:3] 1.

[112:4] Did but my health allow of my being able to undertake a journey without difficulty, and of putting up with the inclemency of the winter, I should, instead of writing, have travelled to your excellency in person, and this for two reasons.

[112:5] First to pay my old debt, for I know that I promised to come to Sebastia and to have the pleasure of seeing your excellency; I did indeed come, but I failed to meet you because I arrived a little later than your lordship; secondly, to be my own ambassador, because I have hitherto shrunk from sending, from the idea that I am too insignificant to win such a boon, and at the same time reckoning that no one by merely writing would be so likely to persuade any one of public or private rank, in behalf of any one, as by a personal interview, in which one might clear up some points in the charges, as to others make entreaty, and for others implore pardon; none of which ends can be easily achieved by a letter.

[112:6] Now against all this I can only set one thing, your most excellent self; and because it will suffice to tell you my mind in the matter, and all that is wanting you will add of yourself, I have ventured to write as I do.

[112:7] 2.

[112:8] But you see how from my hesitation, and because I put off explaining the reasons of my pleading, I write in roundabout phrase.

[112:9] This man Domitianus has been an intimate friend of my own and of my parents from the beginning, and is like a brother to me.

[112:10] Why should I not speak the truth? When I learnt the reasons for his being in his present troubles, I said that he had only got what he deserved.

[112:11] For I hoped that no one who has ever committed any offence be it small or great, will escape punishment.

[112:12] But when I saw him living a life of insecurity and disgrace, and felt that his only hope depends on your decision, I thought that he had been punished enough; and so I implore you to be magnanimous and humane in the view you take of his case.

[112:13] To have one's opponents under one's power is right and proper for a man of spirit and authority; but to be kind and gentle to the fallen is the mark of the man supereminent in greatness of soul, and in inclemency.

[112:14] So, if you will, it is in your power to exhibit your magnanimity in the case of the same man, both in punishing him and in saving him.

[112:15] Let the fear Domitian has of what he suspects, and of what he knows he deserves to suffer, be the extent of his chastisement.

[112:16] I entreat you to add nothing to his punishment, for consider this: many in former times, of whom no record has reached us, have had those who wronged them in their power.

[112:17] But those who surpassed their fellows in philosophy did not persist in their wrath, and of these the memory has been handed down, immortal through all time.

[112:18] Let this glory be added to what history will say of you.

[112:19] Grant to us, who desire to celebrate your praises, to be able to go beyond the instances of kindnesses sung of in days of old.

[112:20] In this manner Croesus, it is said, ceased from his wrath against the slayer of his son, when he gave himself up for punishment, and the great Cyrus was friendly to this very Croesus after his victory.

[112:21] We shall number you with these and shall proclaim this your glory, with all our power, unless we be counted too poor heralds of so great a man.

[112:22] 3.

[112:23] Yet another plea that I ought to urge is this, that we do not chastise transgressors for what is past and gone, (for what means can be devised for undoing the past?) but either that they may be reformed for the future, or may be an example of good behaviour to others.

[112:24] Now, no one could say that either of these points is lacking in the present case; for Domitian will remember what has happened till the day of his death; and I think that all the rest, with his example before them, are dead with alarm.

[112:25] Under these circumstances any addition which we make to his punishment will only look like a satisfaction of our own anger.

[112:26] This I should say is far from being true in your case.

[112:27] I could not indeed be induced to speak of such a thing did I not see that a greater blessing comes to him that gives, than to him that receives.

[112:28] Nor will your magnanimity be known only to a few.

[112:29] All Cappadocia is looking to see what is to be done, and I pray that they may be able to number this among the rest of your good deeds.

[112:30] I shrink from concluding my letter for fear any omission may be to my hurt.

[112:31] But one thing I will add.

[112:32] Domitian has letters from many, who plead for him, but he thinks mine the most important of all, because he has learnt, from whom I know not, that I have influence with your excellency.

[112:33] Do not let the hopes he has placed in me be blasted; do not let me lose my credit among my people here; be entreated, illustrious sir, and grant my boon.

[112:34] You have viewed human life as clearly as ever philosopher viewed it, and you know how goodly is the treasure laid up for all those who give their help to the needy.

[113:1] Letter CXIII.

[113:2] To the presbyters of Tarsus.

[113:3] On meeting this man, I heartily thanked God that by means of his visit He had comforted me in many afflictions and had through him shewn me clearly your love.

[113:4] I seem to see in one man's disposition the zeal of all of you for the truth.

[113:5] He will tell you of our discourses with one another.

[113:6] What you ought to learn directly from me is as follows.

[113:7] We live in days when the overthrow of the Churches seems imminent; of this I have long been cognisant.

[113:8] There is no edification of the Church; no correction of error; no sympathy for the weak; no single defence of sound brethren; no remedy is found either to heal the disease which has already seized us, or as a preventive against that which we expect.

[113:9] Altogether the state of the Church (if I may use a plain figure though it may seem too humble an one) is like an old coat, which is always being torn and can never be restored to its original strength.

[113:10] At such a time, then, there is need of great effort and diligence that the Churches may in some way be benefited.

[113:11] It is an advantage that parts hitherto severed should be united.

[113:12] Union would be effected if we were willing to accommodate ourselves to the weaker, where we can do so without injury to souls; since, then, many mouths are open against the Holy Ghost, and many tongues whetted to blasphemy against Him, we implore you, as far as in you lies, to reduce the blasphemers to a small number, and to receive into communion all who do not assert the Holy Ghost to be a creature, that the blasphemers may be left alone, and may either be ashamed and return to the truth, or, if they abide in their error, may cease to have any importance from the smallness of their numbers.

[113:13] Let us then seek no more than this, but propose to all the brethren, who are willing to join us, the Nicene Creed.

[113:14] If they assent to that, let us further require that the Holy Ghost ought not to be called a creature, nor any of those who say so be received into communion.

[113:15] I do not think that we ought to insist upon anything beyond this.

[113:16] For I am convinced that by longer communication and mutual experience without strife, if anything more requires to be added by way of explanation, the Lord Who worketh all things together for good for them that love Him, will grant it.

[114:1] Letter CXIV.

[114:2] To Cyriacus, at Tarsus.

[114:3] I need hardly tell the sons of peace how great is the blessing of peace.

[114:4] But now this blessing, great, marvellous, and worthy as it is of being most strenuously sought by all that love the Lord, is in peril of being reduced to the bare name, because iniquity abounds, and the love of most men has waxed cold.

[114:5] I think then that the one great end of all who are really and truly serving the Lord ought to be to bring back to union the Churches now "at sundry times and in divers manners" divided from one another.

[114:6] In attempting myself to effect this, I cannot fairly be blamed as a busybody, for nothing is so characteristically Christian as the being a peacemaker, and for this reason our Lord has promised us peacemakers a very high reward.

[114:7] When, therefore, I had met the brethren, and learnt how great was their brotherly love, their regard for you, and yet more their love for Christ, and their exactitude and firmness in all that concerns the faith, and moreover their earnestness in compassing two ends, the not being separated from your love, and the not abandoning their sound faith, I approved of their good disposition; and I now write to your reverence beseeching you with all love to retain them in true union, and associated with you in all your anxiety for the Church.

[114:8] I have moreover pledged myself to them for your orthodoxy, and that you too by God's grace are enrolled to fight with all vigour for the truth, whatever you may have to suffer for the true doctrine.

[114:9] My own opinion is that the following conditions are such as will not run counter to your own feeling and will be quite sufficient to satisfy the above mentioned brethren; namely, that you should confess the faith put forth by our Fathers once assembled at Nicaea, that you should not omit any one of its propositions, but bear in mind that the three hundred and eighteen who met together without strife did not speak without the operation of the Holy Ghost, and not to add to that creed the statement that the Holy Ghost is a creature, nor hold communion with those who so say, to the end that the Church of God may be pure and without any evil admixture of any tare.

[114:10] If this full assurance is given them by your good feeling, they are prepared to offer proper submission to you.

[114:11] And I myself promise for the brethren that they will offer no opposition, but will show themselves entirely subordinate, if only your excellency shall have readily granted this one thing which they ask for.

[115:1] Letter CXV.

[115:2] To the heretic Simplicia.

[115:3] We often ill advisedly hate our superiors and love our inferiors.

[115:4] So I, for my part, hold my tongue, and keep silence about the disgrace of the insults offered me.

[115:5] I wait for the Judge above, Who knows how to punish all wickedness in the end, even though a man pour out gold like sand; let him trample on the right, he does but hurt his own soul.

[115:6] God always asks for sacrifice, not, I think, because He needs it, but because He accepts a pious and right mind as a precious sacrifice.

[115:7] But when a man by his transgressions tramples on himself God reckons his prayers impure.

[115:8] Bethink thyself, then, of the last day, and pray do not try to teach me.

[115:9] I know more than you do, and am not so choked with thorns within.

[115:10] I do not mind tenfold wickedness with a few good qualities.

[115:11] You have stirred up against me lizards and toads, beasts, it is true, of Spring time, but nevertheless unclean.

[115:12] But a bird will come from above who will devour them.

[115:13] The account I have to render is not according to your ideas, but as God thinks fit to judge.

[115:14] If witnesses are wanted, there will not stand before the Judge slaves; nor yet a disgraceful and detestable set of eunuchs; neither woman nor man, lustful, envious, ill-bribed, passionate, effeminate, slaves of the belly, mad for gold, ruthless, grumbling about their dinner, inconstant, stingy, greedy, insatiable, savage, jealous.

[115:15] What more need I say? At their very birth they were condemned to the knife.

[115:16] How can their mind be right when their feet are awry? They are chaste because of the knife, and it is no credit to them.

[115:17] They are lecherous to no purpose, of their own natural vileness.

[115:18] These are not the witnesses who shall stand in the judgment, but rather the eyes of the just and the eyesight of the perfect, of all who are then to see with their eyes what they now see with their understanding.

[116:1] Letter CXVI.

[116:2] To Firminius.

[116:3] You write seldom, and your letters are short, either because you shrink from writing or from avoiding the satiety that comes from excess; or perhaps to train yourself to curt speech.

[116:4] I, indeed, am never satisfied and however abundant be your communication, it is less than my desire, because I wish to know every detail about you.

[116:5] How are you as to health? How as to ascetic discipline? Do you persevere in your original purpose? Or have you formed some new plan, changing your mind according to circumstances? Had you remained the same, I should not have wanted a great number of letters.

[116:6] I should have been quite satisfied with "I am quite well and I hope you are quite well".

[116:7] But I hear what I am ashamed to say, that you have deserted the ranks of your blessed forefathers, and deserted to your paternal grandfather, and are anxious to be rather a Brettanius than a Firminius.

[116:8] I am very anxious to hear about this, and to learn the reasons which have induced you to take to this kind of life.

[116:9] You have yourself been silent; ashamed, I suppose, of your intentions, and therefore I must implore you not to entertain any project, which can be associated with shame.

[116:10] If any such idea has entered into your mind, put it from you, come to yourself again, bid a long farewell to soldiering and arms and the toils of the camp.

[116:11] Return home thinking it, as your forefathers thought before you, quite enough for ease of life and all possible distinction to hold a high place in your city.

[116:12] This, I am sure, you will be able to achieve without difficulty, when I consider your natural gifts and the small number of your rivals.

[116:13] If, then, this was not your original intention, or if after forming it you have rejected it, let me know at once.

[116:14] If, on the other hand, which God forbid, you remain in the same mind, let the trouble come self announced.

[116:15] I do not want a letter.

[117:1] Letter CXVII.

[117:2] Without address.

[117:3] For many reasons I know that I am a debtor to your reverence, and now the anxiety in which I find myself necessarily puts me in the way of services of this kind, although my advisers are mere chance comers, and not like yourself joined to me by many and different ties.

[117:4] There is no need to bring the past under review.

[117:5] I may say that I was the cause of my own difficulties, by determining to leave that good discipline which alone leads to salvation.

[117:6] The result was that in this trouble I soon fell into temptation.

[117:7] What happened has seemed worthy of mention, so that I may not again fall into similar distress.

[117:8] As to the future, I wish to give full assurance to your reverence, that, by God's grace, all will go well, since the proceeding is lawful, and there is no difficulty about it, as many of my friends about the court are ready to help me.

[117:9] I shall therefore have a petition drawn up, similar to the form presented to the Vicar; and, if no delay intervene, I shall promptly get my discharge, and shall be sure to give you relief by sending you the formal document.

[117:10] I feel sure that in this my own convictions have more force than the imperial orders.

[117:11] If I shew this fixed and firm in the highest life, by God's aid the keeping of my chastity will be inviolable and sure.

[117:12] I have been pleased to see the brother entrusted to me by you, and hold him among my intimate friends.

[117:13] I trust he may prove worthy of God and of your good word.

[118:1] Letter CXVIII.

[118:2] To Jovinus, Bishop of Perrha.

[118:3] You owe me a good turn.

[118:4] For I lent you a kindness, which I ought to get back with interest;—a kind of interest, this, which our Lord does not refuse.

[118:5] Pay me, then, my friend, by paying me a visit.

[118:6] So much for the capital; what of the increment? It is the fact of the visit being paid by you, who are a man as much superior to me, as fathers are better than children.

[119:1] Letter CXIX.

[119:2] To Eustathius, Bishop of Sebasteia.

[119:3] I address you by the very honourable and reverend brother Petrus, beseeching you now and ever to pray for me, that I may be changed from ways dangerous and to be shunned, and may be made one day worthy of the name of Christ.

[119:4] Though I say nothing, you will converse together about my affairs, and he will give you an exact account of what has taken place.

[119:5] But you admit without due examination, the vile suspicions against me which will probably be raised by men who have insulted me, in violation of the fear of God and the regard of men.

[119:6] I am ashamed to tell you what treatment I have received from the illustrious Basilius, whom I had accepted at the hands of your reverence as a protection for my life.

[119:7] But, when you have heard what our brother has to say, you will know every detail.

[119:8] I do not thus speak to avenge myself upon him, for I pray that it may not be put to his account by the Lord, but in order that your affection to me may remain firm, and because I am afraid lest it be shaken by the monstrous slanders which these men are pretty sure to make up in defence of their fall.

[119:9] Whatever be the charges they adduce, I hope your intelligence will put these enquiries to them.

[119:10] Have they formally accused me? Have they sought for any correction of the error which they bring against me? Have they made their grievance against me plain? As matters are, by their ignoble flight they have made it evident that under the cheerfulness of their countenance, and their counterfeit expressions of affection, they are all the while hiding in their heart an immense depth of guile and of gall.

[119:11] In all this, whether I narrate it or not, your intelligence knows perfectly well what sorrow they have caused me, and what laughter to those who, always expressing their abomination for the pious life in this wretched city, affirm that the pretence of virtue is practised as a mere trick to get credit, a mere assumption to deceive.

[119:12] So in these days no mode of life is now so suspected of vice by people here as the profession of asceticism.

[119:13] Your intelligence will consider what is the best cure for all this.

[119:14] As to the charges patched up against me by Sophronius, far from being a prelude of blessings, they are a beginning of division and separation, and are likely to lead to even my love growing cold.

[119:15] I implore that by your merciful kindness he may be withheld from his injurious efforts, and that your affection may strive rather to tighten the bonds of what is falling asunder, and not to increase separation by joining with those who are eager for dissent.

[120:1] Letter CXX.

[120:2] To Meletius, bishop of Antioch.

[120:3] I have received a letter from the very God-beloved bishop Eusebius, in which he enjoins that a second letter be written to the Westerns about certain Church matters.

[120:4] He has expressed a wish that the letter should be drawn up by me, and signed by all those who are in communion.

[120:5] Having no means of writing a letter about these wishes of his, I have sent on his minute to your holiness, in order that, when you have read it and can give heed to the information given by the very dear brother Sanctissimus, our fellow presbyter, you may yourself be so good as to indite a letter on these points as seems best to you.

[120:6] We are prepared to agree to it and to lose no time in having it conveyed to those in communion with us, so that, when all have signed it may be carried by the messenger, who is on the point of starting on his journey to visit the bishops of the West.

[120:7] Give orders for the decision of your holiness to be communicated to me as quickly as possible, that I may not be ignorant of your intentions.

[120:8] As to the intrigue which is now being devised, or has already been devised against me, in Antioch, the same brother will convey intimation to your holiness, unless indeed the report of what has been done does not anticipate him and make the position clear.

[120:9] There is ground for hope that the threats are coming to an end.

[120:10] I wish your reverence to know that our brother Anthimus has ordained Faustus, who is living with the pope as bishop, without having received the votes, and in place of our right reverend brother Cyril.

[120:11] Thus he has filled Armenia with schisms.

[120:12] I have thought it right to tell your reverence this, lest they should lie against me, and I be responsible for these disorderly proceedings.

[120:13] You will of course deem it right to make this known to the rest.

[120:14] I think such irregularity will distress many.

[121:1] Letter CXXI.

[121:2] To Theodotus, bishop of Nicopolis.

[121:3] The winter is severe and protracted, so that it is difficult for me even to have the solace of letters.

[121:4] For this reason I have written seldom to your reverence and seldom heard from you, but now my beloved brother Sanctissimus, the co-presbyter, has undertaken a journey as far as your city.

[121:5] By him I salute your lordship, and ask you to pray for me, and to give ear to Sanctissimus, that from him you may learn in what situation the Churches are placed, and may give all possible heed to the points put before you.

[121:6] You must know that Faustus came with letters for me, from the pope, requesting that he might be ordained bishop.

[121:7] When however I asked him for some testimonial from yourself, and the rest of the bishops, he made light of me and betook himself to Anthimus.

[121:8] He came back, ordained by Anthimus, without any communication having been made to me on the subject.

[122:1] Letter CXXII.

[122:2] To Poemenius, bishop of Satala.

[122:3] When the Armenians returned by your way you no doubt asked for a letter from them, and you learnt why I had not given the letter to them.

[122:4] If they spoke as truth lovers should, you forgave me on the spot; if they kept anything back (which I do not suppose), at all events hear it from me.

[122:5] The most illustrious Anthimus, who long ago made peace with me, when he found an opportunity of satisfying his own vain gloriousness, and of causing me some vexation, consecrated Faustus, by his own authority and with his own hand, without waiting for any election from you, and ridiculing my punctiliousness in such matters.

[122:6] Inasmuch, then, as he has confounded ancient order and has made light of you, for whose election I was waiting, and has acted in a manner, as I view it, displeasing to God, for these reasons I felt pained with them, and gave no letter for any of the Armenians, not even for your reverence.

[122:7] Faustus I would not even receive into communion, thereby plainly testifying that, unless he brought me a letter from you, I should be permanently alienated from him, and should influence those of the same mind with me to treat him in the same manner.

[122:8] If there is any remedy for these things, be sure to write to me yourself, giving your testimony to him, if you see that his life is good; and exhort the rest.

[122:9] If on the other hand the mischief is incurable, let me perfectly understand it to be so, that I may no longer take them into account; although really, as they have proved, they have agreed, for the future, to transfer their communion to Anthimus, in contempt of me and of my Church, as though my friendship were no longer worth having.

[123:1] Letter CXXIII.

[123:2] To Urbicius, the monk.

[123:3] You were to have come to see me (and the blessing was drawing near) to cool me, aflame in my temptations, with the tip of your finger.

[123:4] What then? My sins stood in the way and hindered your start, so that I am sick without a remedy.

[123:5] Just as when the waves are round us, one sinks and another rises, and another looms black and dreadful, so of my troubles: some have ceased, some are with me, some are before me.

[123:6] As is generally the case, the one remedy for these troubles is to yield to the crisis and withdraw from my persecutors.

[123:7] Yet come to me, to console, to advise, or even to travel with me; in any case you will make me better for the mere sight of you.

[123:8] Above all, pray, and pray again, that my reason be not whelmed by the waves of my troubles; pray that all through I may keep a heart pleasing to God, that I be not numbered with the wicked servants, who thank a master when he gives them good, and refuse to submit when he chastises them by adversity; but let me reap benefit from my very trials, trusting most in God when I need Him most.

[124:1] Letter CXXIV.

[124:2] To Theodorus.

[124:3] It is sometimes said that slaves to the passion of love, when by some inevitable necessity they are separated from the object of their desire, are able to stay the violence of their passion by indulging the sense of sight, if haply they can look at the picture of the beloved object.

[124:4] Whether this be true or not I cannot say; but what has befallen me in your case, my friend, is not very different.

[124:5] I have felt a disposition towards your godly and guileless soul, somewhat, if I may so say, of the nature of love; but the gratification of my desire, like that of all other blessings, is made difficult to me by the opposition of my sins.

[124:6] However, I have seemed to see a very good likeness of you in the presence of my very reverend brothers.

[124:7] And if it had been my lot to fall in with you when far away from them, I should have fancied that I saw them in you.

[124:8] For the measure of love in each of you is so great, that in both of you there is a plain contest for the superiority.

[124:9] I have thanked God for this.

[124:10] If any longer life be left me, I pray that my life may be made sweet through you, just as now I look on life as a wretched thing to be avoided, because I am separated from the companionship of those I love best.

[124:11] For, in my judgment, there is nothing in which one can be cheerful when cut off from those who truly love us.

[125:1] Letter CXXV.

[125:2] A transcript of the faith as dictated by Saint Basil, and subscribed by Eustathius, bishop of Sebasteia.

[125:3] 1.

[125:4] Both men whose minds have been preoccupied by a heterodox creed and now wish to change over to the congregation of the orthodox, and also those who are now for the first time desirous of being instructed in the doctrine of truth, must be taught the creed drawn up by the blessed fathers in the Council which met at Nicaea.

[125:5] The same training would also be exceedingly useful in the case of all who are under suspicion of being in a state of hostility to sound doctrine, and who by ingenious and plausible excuses keep the depravity of their sentiments out of view.

[125:6] For these too this creed is all that is needed.

[125:7] They will either get cured of their concealed unsoundness, or, by continuing to keep it concealed, will themselves bear the load of the sentence due to their dishonesty, and will provide us with an easy defence in the day of judgment, when the Lord will lift the cover from the hidden things of darkness, and "make manifest the counsels of the hearts".

[125:8] It is therefore desirable to receive them with the confession not only that they believe in the words put forth by our fathers at Nicaea, but also according to the sound meaning expressed by those words.

[125:9] For there are men who even in this creed pervert the word of truth, and wrest the meaning of the words in it to suit their own notions.

[125:10] So Marcellus, when expressing impious sentiments concerning the hypostasis of our Lord Jesus Christ, and describing Him as being Logos and nothing more, had the hardihood to profess to find a pretext for his principles in that creed by affixing an improper sense upon the Homoousion.

[125:11] Some, moreover, of the impious following of the Libyan Sabellius, who understand hypostasis and substance to be identical, derive ground for the establishment of their blasphemy from the same source, because of its having been written in the creed "if any one says that the Son is of a different substance or hypostasis, the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes him".

[125:12] But they did not there state hypostasis and substance to be identical.

[125:13] Had the words expressed one and the same meaning, what need of both? It is on the contrary clear that while by some it was denied that the Son was of the same substance with the Father, and some asserted that He was not of the substance and was of some other hypostasis, they thus condemned both opinions as outside that held by the Church.

[125:14] When they set forth their own view, they declared the Son to be of the substance of the Father, but they did not add the words "of the hypostasis".

[125:15] The former clause stands for the condemnation of the faulty view; the latter plainly states the dogma of salvation.

[125:16] We are therefore bound to confess the Son to be of one substance with the Father, as it is written; but the Father to exist in His own proper hypostasis, the Son in His, and the Holy Ghost in His, as they themselves have clearly delivered the doctrine.

[125:17] They indeed clearly and satisfactorily declared in the words Light of Light, that the Light which begat and the Light which was begotten, are distinct, and yet Light and Light; so that the definition of the Substance is one and the same.

[125:18] I will now subjoin the actual creed as it was drawn up at Nicaea.

[125:31] [Omit all the Anathemas.

[125:32] ]  3.

[125:33] Here then all points but one are satisfactorily and exactly defined, some for the correction of what had been corrupted, some as a precaution against errors expected to arise.

[125:34] The doctrine of the Spirit, however, is merely mentioned, as needing no elaboration, because at the time of the Council no question was mooted, and the opinion on this subject in the hearts of the faithful was exposed to no attack.

[125:35] Little by little, however, the growing poison-germs of impiety, first sown by Arius, the champion of the heresy, and then by those who succeeded to his inheritance of mischief, were nurtured to the plague of the Church, and the regular development of the impiety issued in blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.

[125:36] Under these circumstances we are under the necessity of putting before the men who have no pity for themselves, and shut their eyes to the inevitable threat directed by our Lord against blasphemers of the Holy Ghost, their bounden duty.

[125:37] They must anathematize all who call the Holy Ghost a creature, and all who so think; all who do not confess that He is holy by nature, as the Father is holy by nature, and the Son is holy by nature, and refuse Him His place in the blessed divine nature.

[125:38] Our not separating Him from Father and Son is a proof of our right mind, for we are bound to be baptized in the terms we have received and to profess belief in the terms in which we are baptized, and as we have professed belief in, so to give glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and to hold aloof from the communion of all who call Him creature, as from open blasphemers.

[125:39] One point must be regarded as settled; and the remark is necessary because of our slanderers; we do not speak of the Holy Ghost as unbegotten, for we recognise one Unbegotten and one Origin of all things, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: nor do we speak of the Holy Ghost as begotten, for by the tradition of the faith we have been taught one Only-begotten: the Spirit of truth we have been taught to proceed from the Father, and we confess Him to be of God without creation.

[125:40] We are also bound to anathematize all who speak of the Holy Ghost as ministerial, inasmuch as by this term they degrade Him to the rank of a creature.

[125:41] For that the ministering spirits are creatures we are told by Scripture in the words "they are all ministering spirits sent forth to minister".

[125:42] But because of men who make universal confusion, and do not keep the doctrine of the Gospels, it is necessary to add yet this further, that they are to be shunned, as plainly hostile to true religion, who invert the order left us by the Lord, and put the Son before the Father, and the Holy Spirit before the Son.

[125:43] For we must keep unaltered and inviolable that order which we have received from the very words of the Lord, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost".

[125:44] I, Eustathius, bishop, have read to thee, Basil, and understood; and I assent to what is written above.

[125:45] I have signed in the presence of our Fronto, Severus, the chorepiscopus, and several other clerics.

[126:1] Letter CXXVI.

[126:2] To Atarbius.

[126:3] On arriving at Nicopolis in the double hope of settling the disturbances which had arisen, and applying a remedy, as far as possible, to measures taken in a disorderly manner and in violation of the law of the Church, I was exceedingly disappointed at failing to meet you.

[126:4] I heard that you had hurriedly withdrawn, and actually from the very synod which was being held by you.

[126:5] I am, therefore, under the necessity of having recourse to writing, and by this letter I bid you present yourself before me, that you may in person apply some remedy to the pain which I felt, even unto death, on hearing that you had ventured on action, in the very middle of the church, of the like of which I hitherto have never heard.

[126:6] All this, although painful and serious, is endurable, as having happened to a man who has committed the punishment due for his sufferings to God, and is wholly devoted to peace and to preventing harm falling from any fault of his on God's people.

[126:7] Since, however, some honourable brethren, worthy of all credit, have told me that you have introduced certain innovations into the faith, and have spoken against sound doctrine, I am under the circumstances the more agitated, and above measure anxious, lest, in addition to the countless wounds which have been inflicted on the Church by traitors to the truth of the Gospel, yet a further calamity should spring up in the renewal of the ancient heresy of Sabellius, the enemy of the Church; for to this the brethren have reported your utterances to be akin.

[126:8] I have, therefore, written to charge you not to shrink from undertaking a short journey to come to me, and, by giving me full assurance in the matter, at once to alleviate my pangs, and to solace the Churches of God, which are now pained to a grave, nay an unendurable extent, at your actions and your reported words.

[127:1] Letter CXXVII.

[127:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[127:3] Our merciful God, Who makes comfort match trouble, and consoles the lowly, lest they be drowned unawares in exceeding grief, has sent a consolation, equivalent to the troubles I have suffered in Nicopolis, in seasonably bringing me the God-beloved bishop Jobinus.

[127:4] He must tell you himself how very opportune his visit was.

[127:5] I shrink from a long letter, and will hold my peace.

[127:6] And I am the more inclined to silence, lest I seem as it were to put a mark on men, who have turned round and begun to show regard to me, by mentioning their fall.

[127:7] God grant that you may come to see me in my own home, so that I may embrace your reverence and tell you everything in detail.

[127:8] For we often find some comfort in telling what is painful in actual experience.

[127:9] However, for all that the very godly bishop has done, fully as far as regards his affection for me, and preeminently and stoutly as regards the exact observance of the canons, commend him.

[127:10] Moreover, thank God that your pupils everywhere exhibit your reverence's character.

[128:1] Letter CXXVIII.

[128:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[128:3] 1.

[128:4] Hitherto I have been unable to give any adequate and practical proof of my earnest desire to pacify the Churches of the Lord.

[128:5] But in my heart I affirm that I have so great a longing, that I would gladly give up even my life, if thereby the flame of hatred, kindled by the evil one, could be put out.

[128:6] If it was not for the sake of this longing for peace that I consented to come to Colonia, may my life be unblessed by peace.

[128:7] The peace I seek is the true peace, left us by the Lord Himself; and what I have asked that I may have for my assurance belongs to one who desires nothing but the true peace, although some perversely interpret the truth into another sense.

[128:8] Let them use their tongues as they will, but assuredly they will one day be sorry for their words.

[128:9] 2.

[128:10] Now I beseech your holiness to remember the original propositions, and not to be led away by receiving answers that do not fit the questions, nor yet to give practical weight to the quibbles of men who, without any power of argument, very cleverly pervert the truth, from their own ideas alone.

[128:11] I set out propositions which were perfectly simple, clear and easy to remember; do we decline to receive into communion those who refuse to accept the Nicene Creed? Do we refuse to have part or lot with those who have the hardihood to assert that the Holy Ghost is a creature? He, however, instead of answering my questions word for word, has concocted the statement which you have sent me:—and this not from simplemindedness, as might be imagined, nor yet from his inability to see the consequences.

[128:12] What he reckons is that, by repudiating my proposition, he will expose his true character to the people; while, if he agrees to it, he will depart from that via media which has hitherto seemed to him preferable to any other position.

[128:13] Let him not try to beguile me, nor, with the rest, deceive your intelligence.

[128:14] Let him send a concise answer to my question, whether he accepts or repudiates communion with the enemies of the faith.

[128:15] If you get him to do this and send me such a distinct answer as I pray for, I own myself in error in all that has gone before; I take all the blame upon myself; then ask from me a proof of humility.

[128:16] But, if nothing of the kind come to pass, pardon me, most God-beloved father, in my inability to approach God's altar with hypocrisy.

[128:17] Were it not for this dread, why should I separate myself from Euippius, so learned a man, so advanced in age, and bound to me by so many ties of affection? If, however, in this case I acted rightly, it would, I am sure, be absurd to appear united with those who maintain the same views as Euippius, through the mediation of these amiable and charming persons.

[128:18] 3.

[128:19] Not that I think it is absolutely our duty to cut ourselves off from those who do not receive the faith, but rather to have regard to them in accordance with the old law of love, and to write to them with one consent, giving them all exhortation with pity, and to propose to them the faith of the fathers, and invite them to union.

[128:20] If we succeed we should be united in communion with them; if we fail we must be content with one another and purge our conduct of this uncertain spirit, restoring the evangelical and simple conversation followed by those who accepted the Word from the beginning.

[128:21] "They," it is said, "were of one heart and of one soul".

[128:22] If they obey you, this will be best; if not, recognise the real authors of the war, and, for the future do not write me any more letters about reconciliation.

[129:1] Letter CXXIX.

[129:2] To Meletius Bishop of Antioch.

[129:3] 1.

[129:4] I knew that the charge which had lately sprung up against the loquacious Apollinarius would sound strange in the ears of your excellency.

[129:5] I did not know myself, till now, that he was accused; at the present time, however, the Sebastenes, after search in some quarter or another, have brought these things forward, and they are carrying about a document for which they are specially trying to condemn me on the ground that I hold the same sentiments.

[129:6] It contains the following phrases.

[129:7] "Wherefore it is everywhere necessary to understand the first identity in conjunction with, or rather in union with, the second, and to say that the second and the third are the same.

[129:8] For what the Father is firstly, the Son is secondly, and the Spirit thirdly.

[129:9] And, again, what the Spirit is firstly, the Son is secondly, in so far as the Spirit is the Lord; and the Father thirdly, in so far as the Spirit is God.

[129:10] And, to express the ineffable with greatest force, the Father is Son in a paternal sense, and the Son Father in a filial sense, and so in the case of the Spirit, in so far as the Trinity is one God".

[129:11] This is what is being bruited about.

[129:12] I never can believe it to have been invented by those through whom it has been published, although, after their slanders against me, I can regard nothing as beyond their audacity.

[129:13] For writing to some of their party, they advanced their false accusation against me, and then added the words I have quoted, describing them as the work of heretics, but saying nothing as to the author of the document, in order that it might vulgarly be supposed to have come from my pen.

[129:14] Nevertheless, in my opinion, their intelligence would not have gone far enough in putting the phrases together.

[129:15] On this account, in order to repudiate the growing blasphemy against myself, and shew to all the world that I have nothing in common with those who make such statements, I have been compelled to mention Apollinarius as approximating to the impiety of Sabellius.

[129:16] Of this subject I will say no more.

[129:17] 2.

[129:18] I have received a message from the court that, after the first impulse of the Emperor, to which he was impelled by my calumniators, a second decree has been passed, that I am not to be delivered to my accusers, nor given over to their will, as was ordered at the beginning; but that there has been in the meanwhile some delay.

[129:19] If then this obtains, or any gentler measure is determined on, I will let you know.

[129:20] If the former prevails, it shall not be so, without your knowledge.

[129:21] 3.

[129:22] Our brother Sanctissimus has certainly been with you a long time, and you have learnt the objects he has in view.

[129:23] If, then, the letter to the Westerns seems to you to contain at all what is requisite, be so good as to have it written out and conveyed to me, that I may get it signed by those who think with us, and may keep the subscription ready, and written out on a separate paper, which we can fasten on to the letter which is being carried about by our brother and fellow presbyter.

[129:24] As I did not find in the minute anything conclusive, I was in a difficulty on what point to write to the Westerns.

[129:25] Necessary points are anticipated, and it is useless to write what is superfluous, and on such points would it not be ridiculous to show feeling? One subject, however, did appear to me to be hitherto untouched, and to suggest a reason for writing, and that was an exhortation to them not indiscriminately to accept the communion of men coming from the East; but, after once choosing one side, to receive the rest on the testimony of their fellows, and not to assent to every one writing a form of creed on the pretext of orthodoxy.

[129:26] If they do so, they will be found in communion with men at war with one another, who often put forward the same formulae, and yet battle vehemently against one another, as those who are most widely separated.

[129:27] To the end, then, that the heresy may not be the more widely kindled, while those who are at variance with one another mutually object to their own formulae, they ought to be exhorted to make a distinction between the acts of communion which are brought them by chance comers, and those which are duly drawn up according to the rule of the Church.

[130:1] Letter CXXX.

[130:2] To Theodotus bishop of Nicopolis.

[130:3] 1.

[130:4] You have very rightly and properly blamed me, right honourable and well beloved brother, in that ever since I departed from your reverence, conveying to Eustathius those propositions about the faith, I have told you neither much nor little about his business.

[130:5] This neglect is really not due to any contempt on my part for the way in which he has treated me, but simply to the fact that the story is now published abroad in all men's ears, and nobody needs any instructions from me in order to learn what his intentions are.

[130:6] For this he has had good heed, as though he were really afraid that he would have few witnesses of his opinion, and has sent to the ends of the earth the letter which he has written against me.

[130:7] He has therefore severed himself from communion with me.

[130:8] He did not consent to meet me at the appointed spot, and did not bring his disciples, as he had promised.

[130:9] On the contrary, he publicly stigmatized me in the public synods, with the Cilician Theophilus, by the open and undisguised slander of sowing in the souls of the people doctrines at variance with his own teaching.

[130:10] This was quite enough to break up all union between us.

[130:11] Afterwards he came to Cilicia, and, on meeting with a certain Gelasius, showed him the creed which only an Arian, or a thorough disciple of Arius, could subscribe.

[130:12] Then, indeed, I was yet more confirmed in my alienation from him.

[130:13] I felt that the Ethiopian will never change his skin, nor the leopard his spots, nor a man nurtured in doctrines of perversity ever be able to rub off the stain of his heresy.

[130:14] 2.

[130:15] In addition to all this he has had the impudence to write against me, or rather to compose long discourses full of all kinds of abuse and calumny.

[130:16] To these, up to this time, I have answered nothing, taught as we are by the Apostle, not to avenge ourselves, but to give place unto wrath.

[130:17] Moreover, at the thought of the depth of the hypocrisy with which he has all along approached me, I have, in a way, become speechless with amazement.

[130:18] But, if all this had never happened, who would not feel horror and detestation of the fellow at this fresh piece of audacity? Now, as I hear, if the report is really true and not a slanderous invention, he has ventured to re-ordain certain men; a proceeding on which so far no heretic has ventured.

[130:19] How then can I quietly endure such treatment? How can I look upon the errors of the man as curable? Beware, then, of being led away by lies; do not be moved by the suspicions of men who are prone to look at everything in a bad light, as though I were making little of such things.

[130:20] For, be sure, my very dear and honourable friend, that I have never at any time been so grieved as I am now, on hearing of this confusion of the laws of the Church.

[130:21] Pray only that the Lord grant me to take no step in anger, but to maintain charity, which behaveth itself not unseemly and is not puffed up.

[130:22] Only look how men without charity have been lifted up beyond all human bounds and conduct themselves in an unseemly manner, daring deeds which have no precedent in all the past.

[131:1] Letter CXXXI.

[131:2] To Olympius.

[131:3] 1.

[131:4] Truly unexpected tidings make both ears tingle.

[131:5] This is my case.

[131:6] These compositions against me, which are being carried about, have fallen upon ears by this time pretty well seasoned, on account of my having formerly received the letter, appropriate enough to my sins, but which I should never have expected to be written by those who sent it.

[131:7] Nevertheless what followed did seem to me so extraordinarily cruel as to blot out all that had gone before.

[131:8] How could I fail to be driven almost out of my senses when I read the letter addressed to the reverend brother Dazinas, full of outrageous insults and calumnies and of attacks against me, as though I had been convicted of much pernicious designs against the Church? Moreover proofs were forthwith offered of the truth of the calumnies against me, from the document of whose authorship I am ignorant.

[131:9] Parts I recognise, I own, as having been written by Apollinarius of Laodicea.

[131:10] These I had purposely not even ever read, but I had heard of them from the report of others.

[131:11] Other portions I found included, which I had never either read or heard of from any one else; of the truth of this there is a faithful witness in heaven.

[131:12] How then can men who shun lies, who have learnt that love is the fulfilling of the law, who profess to bear the burdens of the weak, have consented to bring these calumnies against me and to condemn me out of other men's writings? I have often asked myself this question, but I cannot imagine the reason, unless it be, as I have said from the beginning, that my pain in all this is a part of the punishment which is due to my sins.

[131:13] 2.

[131:14] First of all I sorrowed in soul that truths were lessened by the sons of men; in the second place I feared for my own self, lest in addition to my other sins, I should become a misanthrope, believing no truth and honour to be left in any man; if indeed those whom I have most greatly trusted are proved to be so disposed both to me and to the truth.

[131:15] Be sure then, my brother, and every one who is a friend of the truth, that the composition is not mine; I do not approve of it, for it is not drawn up according to my views.

[131:16] Even if I did write, a good many years ago, to Apollinarius or to any one else, I ought not to be blamed.

[131:17] I find no fault myself if any member of any society has been cut off into heresy (and you know perfectly well whom I mean though I mention nobody by name), because each man will die in his own sin.

[131:18] This is my reply to the document sent me, that you may know the truth, and make it plain to all who wish not to hold the truth in unrighteousness.

[131:19] If it prove necessary to defend myself more at length on each separate count, I will do so, God being my helper.

[131:20] I, brother Olympius, neither maintain three Gods, nor communicate with Apollinarius.

[132:1] Letter CXXXII.

[132:2] To Abramius, bishop of Batnae.

[132:3] Ever since the autumn I have been quite ignorant of the whereabouts of your reverence; for I kept hearing uncertain rumours, some saying that you were stopping at Samosata, and some in the country, while others maintained that they had seen you at Batnae.

[132:4] This is the reason of my not writing frequently.

[132:5] Now, on hearing that you are staying at Antioch, in the house of the honourable Count Saturninus, I have been glad to give this letter to our beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, our fellow presbyter, by whom I salute you, and exhort you, whereever you be, to remember firstly God, and secondly myself, whom you determined from the beginning to love and to reckon among your most intimate friends.

[133:1] Letter CXXXIII.

[133:2] To Peter, bishop of Alexandria.

[133:3] The sight of the eyes brings about bodily friendship, and long companionship strengthens it, but genuine regard is the gift of the Spirit, Who unites what is separated by long distances, and makes friends known to one another, not by bodily qualities, but by the characteristics of the soul.

[133:4] The grace of the Lord has granted me this favour, by permitting me to see you with the soul's eye, and to embrace you with genuine affection, and as it were, to be drawn very near to you, and to come into close union with you in the communion of faith.

[133:5] I am sure that you, disciple as you are of so great a man, and long associated with him, will walk in the same spirit and follow the same doctrines of true religion.

[133:6] Under these circumstances I address your excellency, and beseech you that among the other things in which you have succeeded that great man, you will succeed him in love to me, that you will frequently write me news of you, and will give heed to the brotherhood all over the world with the same affection and the same zeal which that most blessed man always showed to all that love God in truth.

[134:1] Letter CXXXIV.

[134:2] To the presbyter Poeonius.

[134:3] You may conjecture from what it contains, what pleasure you have given me by your letter.

[134:4] The pureness of heart, from which such expressions sprang, was plainly signified by what you wrote.

[134:5] A streamlet tells of its own spring, and so the manner of speech marks the heart from which it came.

[134:6] I must confess that an extraordinary and improbable thing has happened to me.

[134:7] For deeply anxious as I always was to receive a letter from your excellency, when I had taken your letter into my hand and had read it, I was not so much pleased at what you had written, as annoyed at reckoning up the loss I had suffered in your long silence.

[134:8] Now that you have begun to write, pray do not leave off.

[134:9] You will give me greater pleasure than men can give by sending much money to misers.

[134:10] I have had no writer with me, neither caligraphist, nor short-hand.

[134:11] Of all those whom I happen to employ, some have returned to their former mode of life, and others are unfit for work from long sickness.

[135:1] Letter CXXXV.

[135:2] To Diodorus, presbyter of Antioch.

[135:3] 1.

[135:4] I have read the books sent me by your excellency.

[135:5] With the second I was delighted, not only with its brevity, as was likely to be the case with a reader out of health and inclined to indolence, but, because it is at once full of thought, and so arranged that the objections of opponents, and the answers to them, stand out distinctly.

[135:6] Its simple and natural style seems to me to befit the profession of a Christian who writes less for self-advertisement than for the general good.

[135:7] The former work, which has practically the same force, but is much more elaborately adorned with rich diction, many figures, and niceties of dialogue, seems to me to require considerable time to read, and much mental labour, both to gather its meaning and retain it in the memory.

[135:8] The abuse of our opponents and the support of our own side, which are thrown in, although they may seem to add some charms of dialectic to the treatise, do yet break the continuity of the thought and weaken the strength of the argument, by causing interruption and delay.

[135:9] I know that your intelligence is perfectly well aware that the heathen philosophers who wrote dialogues, Aristotle and Theophrastus, went straight to the point, because they were aware of their not being gifted with the graces of Plato.

[135:10] Plato, on the other hand, with his great power of writing, at the same time attacks opinions and incidentally makes fun of his characters, assailing now the rashness and recklessness of a Thrasymachus, the levity and frivolity of a Hippias, and the arrogance and pomposity of a Protagoras.

[135:11] When, however, he introduces unmarked characters into his dialogues, he uses the interlocutors for making the point clear, but does not admit anything more belonging to the characters into his argument.

[135:12] An instance of this is in the Laws.

[135:13] 2.

[135:14] It is well for us too, who betake ourselves to writing, not from any vain ambition, but from the design of bequeathing counsels of sound doctrine to the brethren, if we introduce some character well known to all the world for presumption of manners, to interweave into the argument some points in accordance with the quality of the character, unless indeed we have no right at all to leave our work and to accuse men.

[135:15] But if the subject of the dialogue be wide and general, digressions against persons interrupt its continuity and tend to no good end.

[135:16] So much I have written to prove that you did not send your work to a flatterer, but have shared your toil with a real brother.

[135:17] And I have spoken not for the correction of what is finished, but as a precaution for the future; for assuredly one who is so accustomed to write, and so diligent in writing, will not hesitate to do so; and the more so that there is no falling off in the number of those who give him subjects.

[135:18] Enough for me to read your books.

[135:19] I am as far from being able to write anything as, I had very nearly said, I am from being well, or from having the least leisure from my work.

[135:20] I have however now sent back the larger and earlier of the two volumes, after perusing it as far as I have been able.

[135:21] The second I have retained, with the wish to transcribe it, but, hitherto, without finding any quick writer.

[135:22] To such a pitch of poverty has come the enviable condition of the Cappadocians!.

[136:1] Letter CXXXVI.

[136:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[136:3] 1.

[136:4] In what state the good Isaaces has found me, he himself will best explain to you; though his tongue cannot be tragic enough to describe my sufferings, so great was my illness.

[136:5] However, any one who knows me ever so little, will be able to conjecture what it was.

[136:6] For, if when I am called well, I am weaker even than persons who are given over, you may fancy what I was when thus ill.

[136:7] Yet, since disease is my natural state, it would follow (let a fever have its jest) that in this change of habit, my health became especially flourishing.

[136:8] But it is the scourge of the Lord which goes on increasing my pain according to my deserts; therefore I have received illness upon illness, so that now even a child may see that this shell of mine must for certain fail, unless perchance, God's mercy vouchsafe to me, in His long suffering, time for repentance, and now, as often before, extricate me from evils beyond human cure.

[136:9] This shall be, as it is pleasing to Him and good for myself.

[136:10] 2.

[136:11] I need hardly tell you how deplorable and hopeless is the condition of the Churches.

[136:12] Now, for the sake of our own safety, we neglect our neighbour's, and do not even seem able to see that general disaster involves individual ruin.

[136:13] Least of all need I say this to one who, like yourself, foresaw the future from afar, and has foretold and proclaimed it and has been among the first to be roused, and to rouse the rest, writing letters, coming yourself in person, leaving no deed undone, no word unspoken.

[136:14] I remember this in every instance, but yet we are none the better off.

[136:15] Now, indeed, were not my sins in the way, (first of all, my dear brother the reverend deacon Eustathius fell seriously ill and detained me two whole months, looking day by day for his restoration to health; and then all about me fell sick; brother Isaaces will tell you the rest; then last of all I myself was attacked by this complaint) I should long ago have been to see your excellency, not indeed thereby to try to improve the general state of affairs, but to get some good for myself from your society.

[136:16] I had made up my mind to get out of the reach of the ecclesiastical artillery, because I am quite unprepared to meet my enemies' attacks.

[136:17] May God's mighty hand preserve you for all of us, as a noble guardian of the faith, and a vigilant champion of the Churches; and grant me, before I die, to meet you for the comfort of my soul.

[137:1] Letter CXXXVII.

[137:2] To Antipater, on his assuming the governorship of Cappadocia.

[137:3] I do now really feel the loss which I suffer from being ill; so that, when such a man succeeds to the government of my country, my having to nurse myself compels me to be absent.

[137:4] For a whole month I have been undergoing the treatment of natural hot springs, in the hope of drawing some benefit from them.

[137:5] But I seem to be troubling myself to no purpose in my solitude, or indeed to be deservedly a laughing stock to mankind, for not heeding the proverb which says "warmth is no good to the dead".

[137:6] Even situated as I am, I am very anxious to put aside everything else, and betake myself to your excellency, that I may enjoy the benefit of all your high qualities, and through your goodness settle all my home affairs here in a proper manner.

[137:7] The house of our reverend mother Palladia is my own, for I am not only nearly related to her, but regard her as a mother on account of her character.

[137:8] Now, as some disturbance has been raised about her house, I ask your excellency to postpone the enquiry for a little while, and to wait till I come; not at all that justice may not be done, for I had rather die ten thousand times than ask a favour of that kind from a judge who is a friend of law and right, but that you may learn from me by word of mouth matters which it would be unbecoming for me to write.

[137:9] If you do so you will in no wise fail in fealty to the truth, and we shall suffer no harm.

[137:10] I beg you then to keep the individual in question in safe custody under the charge of the troops, and not refuse to grant me this harmless favour.

[138:1] Letter CXXXVIII.

[138:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[138:3] 1.

[138:4] What was my state of mind, think you, when I received your piety's letter? When I thought of the feelings which its language expressed, I was eager to fly straight to Syria; but when I thought of the bodily illness, under which I lay bound, I saw myself unequal, not only to flying, but even to turning on my bed.

[138:5] This day, on which our beloved and excellent brother and deacon, Elpidius, has arrived, is the fiftieth of my illness.

[138:6] I am much reduced by the fever.

[138:7] For lack of what it might feed on, it lingers in this dry flesh as in an expiring wick, and so has brought on a wasting and tedious illness.

[138:8] Next my old plague, the liver, coming upon it, has kept me from taking nourishment, prevented sleep, and held me on the confines of life and death, granting just life enough to feel its inflictions.

[138:9] In consequence I have had recourse to the hot springs, and have availed myself of help from medical men.

[138:10] But for all these the mischief has proved too strong.

[138:11] Perhaps another man might endure it, but, coming as it did unexpectedly, no one is so stout as to bear it.

[138:12] Long troubled by it as I have been, I have never been so distressed as now at being prevented by it from meeting you and enjoying your true friendship.

[138:13] I know of how much pleasure I am deprived, although last year I did touch with the tip of my finger the sweet honey of your Church.

[138:14] 2.

[138:15] For many urgent reasons I felt bound to meet your reverence, both to discuss many things with you and to learn many things from you.

[138:16] Here it is not possible even to find genuine affection.

[138:17] And, could one even find a true friend, none can give counsel to me in the present emergency with anything like the wisdom and experience which you have acquired in your many labours on the Church's behalf.

[138:18] The rest I must not write.

[138:19] I may, however, safely say what follows.

[138:20] The presbyter Evagrius, son of Pompeianus of Antioch, who set out some time ago to the West with the blessed Eusebius, has now returned from Rome.

[138:21] He demands from me a letter couched in the precise terms dictated by the Westerns.

[138:22] My own he has brought back again to me, and reports that it did not give satisfaction to the more precise authorities there.

[138:23] He also asks that a commission of men of repute may be promptly sent, that they may have a reasonable pretext for visiting me.

[138:24] My sympathisers in Sebasteia have stripped the covering from the secret sore of the unorthodoxy of Eustathius, and demand my ecclesiastical care.

[138:25] Iconium is a city of Pisidia, anciently the first after the greatest, and now it is capital of a part, consisting of an union of different portions, and allowed the government of a distinct province.

[138:26] Iconium too calls me to visit her and to give her a bishop; for Faustinus is dead.

[138:27] Whether I ought to shrink from consecrations over the border; what answer I ought to give to the Sebastenes; what attitude I should show to the propositions of Evagrius; all these are questions to which I was anxious to get answers in a personal interview with you, for here in my present weakness I am cut off from everything.

[138:28] If, then, you can find any one soon coming this way, be so good as to give me your answer on them all.

[138:29] If not, pray that what is pleasing to the Lord may come into my mind.

[138:30] In your synod also bid mention to be made of me, and pray for me yourself, and join your people with you in the prayer that it may be permitted me to continue my service through the remaining days or hours of my sojourning here in a manner pleasing to the Lord.

[139:1] Letter CXXXIX.

[139:2] To the Alexandrians.

[139:3] 1.

[139:4] I have already heard of the persecution in Alexandria and the rest of Egypt, and, as might be expected, I am deeply affected.

[139:5] I have observed the ingenuity of the devil's mode of warfare.

[139:6] When he saw that the Church increased under the persecution of enemies and flourished all the more, he changed his plan.

[139:7] He no longer carries on an open warfare, but lays secret snares against us, hiding his hostility under the name which they bear, in order that we may both suffer like our fathers, and, at the same time, seem not to suffer for Christ's sake, because our persecutors too bear the name of Christians.

[139:8] With these thoughts for a long time we sat still, dazed at the news of what had happened, for, in sober earnest, both our ears tingled on hearing of the shameless and inhuman heresy of your persecutors.

[139:9] They have reverenced neither age, nor services to society, nor people's affection.

[139:10] They inflicted torture, ignominy, and exile; they plundered all the property they could find; they were careless alike of human condemnation and of the awful retribution to come at the hands of the righteous Judge.

[139:11] All this has amazed me and all but driven me out of my senses.

[139:12] To my reflections has been added this thought too; can the Lord have wholly abandoned His Churches? Has the last hour come, and is "the falling away" thus coming upon us, that now the lawless one "may be revealed, the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God and is worshipped"? But if the temptation is for a season, bear it, ye noble athletes of Christ.

[139:13] If the world is being delivered to complete, and final destruction, let us not lose heart for the present, but let us await the revelation from heaven, and the manifestation of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.

[139:14] If all creation is to be dissolved, and the fashion of this world transformed, why should we be surprised that we, who are apart of creation, should feel the general woe, and be delivered to afflictions which our just God inflicts on us according to the measure of our strength, not letting us "be tempted above that we are able, but with the temptation giving us a way to escape that we may be able to bear it"? Brothers, martyrs' crowns await you.

[139:15] The companies of the confessors are ready to reach out their hands to you and to welcome you into their own ranks.

[139:16] Remember how none of the saints of old won their crowns of patient endurance by living luxuriously and being courted; but all were tested by being put through the fire of great afflictions.

[139:17] "For some had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, and others were sawn asunder and were slain with the sword".

[139:18] These are the glories of saints.

[139:19] Blessed is he who is deemed worthy to suffer for Christ; more blessed is he whose sufferings are greater, since "the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us".

[139:20] 2.

[139:21] Had it but been possible for me to travel to you I should have liked nothing better than to meet you, that I might see and embrace Christ's athletes, and share your prayers and spiritual graces.

[139:22] But now my body is wasted by long sickness, so that I can scarcely even leave my bed, and there are many who are lying in wait for me, like ravening wolves, watching the moment when they may be able to rend Christ's sheep.

[139:23] I have therefore been compelled to visit you by letter; and I exhort you first of all most earnestly to pray for me, that for the rest of my remaining days or hours I may be enabled to serve the Lord, in accordance with the gospel of His kingdom.

[139:24] Next I beg you to pardon me for my absence and for my delay in writing to you.

[139:25] I have only with great difficulty found a man able to carry out my wishes.

[139:26] I speak of my son, the monk Eugenius, by whom I beseech you to pray for me and for the whole Church, and to write back news of you so that, when I hear, I may be more cheerful.

[140:1] Letter CXL.

[140:2] To the Church of Antioch.

[140:3] 1.

[140:4] "Oh that I had wings like a dove for then would I fly away" to you, and satisfy my longing to meet you.

[140:5] But now it is not only wings that I want, but a whole body, for mine has suffered from long sickness, and now is quite worn away with continuous affliction.

[140:6] For no one can be so hard of heart, so wholly destitute of sympathy and kindness, as to hear the sigh that strikes my ear from every quarter, as though from some sad choir chanting a symphony of lamentation, without being grieved at heart, being bent to the ground, and wasting away with these irremediable troubles.

[140:7] But the holy God is able to provide a remedy for the irremediable, and to grant you a respite from your long toils.

[140:8] I should like you to feel this comfort and, rejoicing in the hope of consolation, to submit to the present pain of your afflictions.

[140:9] Are we paying the penalty of our sins? Then our plagues are such as to save us for the future from the wrath of God.

[140:10] Are we called upon through these temptations to fight for the truth? Then the righteous Giver of the prizes will not suffer us to be tried above that which we are able to bear, but, in return for our previous struggles, will give us the crown of patience and of hope in Him.

[140:11] Let us, therefore, not flinch from fighting a good fight on behalf of the truth, nor, in despair, fling away the labours we have already achieved.

[140:12] For the strength of the soul is not shewn by one brave deed, nor yet by effort only for a short time; but He Who tests our hearts wishes us to win crowns of righteousness after long and protracted trial.

[140:13] Only let our spirit be kept unbroken, the firmness of our faith in Christ be maintained unshaken, and ere long our Champion will appear; He will come and will not tarry.

[140:14] Expect tribulation after tribulation, hope upon hope; yet a little while; yet a little while.

[140:15] Thus the Holy Ghost knows how to comfort His nurslings by a promise of the future.

[140:16] After tribulations comes hope, and what we are hoping for is not far off, for let a man name the whole of human life, it is but a tiny interval compared with the endless age which is laid up in our hopes.

[140:17] 2.

[140:18] Now I accept no newer creed written for me by other men, nor do I venture to propound the outcome of my own intelligence, lest I make the words of true religion merely human words; but what I have been taught by the holy Fathers, that I announce to all who question me.

[140:19] In my Church the creed written by the holy Fathers in synod at Nicaea is in use.

[140:20] I believe that it is also repeated among you; but I do not refuse to write its exact terms in my letter, lest I be accused of taking too little trouble.

[140:21] It is as follows: This is our faith.

[140:22] But no definition was given about the Holy Ghost, the Pneumatomachi not having at that date appeared.

[140:23] No mention was therefore made of the need of anathematizing those who say that the Holy Ghost is of a created and ministerial nature.

[140:24] For nothing in the divine and blessed Trinity is created.

[141:1] Letter CXLI.

[141:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[141:3] 1.

[141:4] I have now received two letters from your divine and most excellent wisdom, whereof the one told me clearly how I had been expected by the laity under the jurisdiction of your holiness, and what disappointment I had caused by failing to attend the sacred synod.

[141:5] The other, which from the writing I conjecture to be of the earlier date, though it was delivered later, gave me advice, at once honourable to yourself and necessary to me, not to neglect the interests of God's Churches, nor little by little to allow the guidance of affairs to pass to our opponents, whereby their interests must win, and ours lose.

[141:6] I think that I answered both.

[141:7] But, as I am uncertain whether my replies were preserved by those who were entrusted with the duty of conveying them, I will make my defence over again.

[141:8] As to my absence, I can put in an unimpeachable plea, as to which I think intelligence must have reached your holiness, that I have been detained by illness which has brought me to the very gates of death.

[141:9] Even now as I write about it, the remains of sickness are still upon me.

[141:10] And they are such as to another man might be unendurable.

[141:11] 2.

[141:12] As to the fact of its not being owing to my neglect that the interests of the Churches have been betrayed to our opponents, I wish your reverence to know that the bishops in communion with me, from lack of earnestness, or because they suspect me and are not open with me, or because the devil is always at hand to oppose good works, are unwilling to cooperate with me.

[141:13] Formerly, indeed, the majority of us were united with one another, including the excellent Bosporius.

[141:14] In reality they give me no aid in what is most essential.

[141:15] The consequence of all this is, that to a great extent my recovery is hindered by my distress, and the sorrow I feel brings back my worst symptoms.

[141:16] What, however, can I do alone and unaided, when the canons, as you yourself know, do not allow points of this kind to be settled by one man? And yet what remedy have I not tried? Of what decision have I failed to remind them, some by letter and some in person? They even came to the city, when they heard a report of my death; when, by God's will, they found me yet alive I made them such a speech as was proper to the occasion.

[141:17] In my presence they respect me, and promise all that is fit, but no sooner have they got back again than they return to their own opinion.

[141:18] In all this I am a sufferer, like the rest, for the Lord has clearly abandoned us, whose love has grown cold because iniquity abounds.

[141:19] For all this may your great and powerful intercession with God be sufficient for me.

[141:20] Perhaps we shall either become of some use, or, even if we fail in our object, we may escape condemnation.

[142:1] Letter CXLII.

[142:2] To the prefects' accountant.

[142:3] I assembled all my brethren the chorepiscopi at the synod of the blessed martyr Eupsychius to introduce them to your excellency.

[142:4] On account of your absence they must be brought before you by letter.

[142:5] Know, therefore, this brother as being worthy to be trusted by your intelligence, because he fears the Lord.

[142:6] As to the matters on behalf of the poor, which he refers to your good-will, deign to believe him as one worthy of credit, and to give the afflicted all the aid in your power.

[142:7] I am sure you will consent to look favourably upon the hospital of the poor which is in his district, and exempt it altogether from taxation.

[142:8] It has already seemed good to your colleague to make the little property of the poor not liable to be rated.

[143:1] Letter CXLIII.

[143:2] To another accountant.

[143:3] Had it been possible for me to meet your excellency I would have in person brought before you the points about which I am anxious, and would have pleaded the cause of the afflicted, but I am prevented by illness and by press of business.

[143:4] I have therefore sent to you in my stead this chorepiscopus, my brother, begging you to give him your aid and use him and to take him into counsel, for his truthfulness and sagacity qualify him to advise in such matters.

[143:5] If you are so good as to inspect the hospital for the poor, which is managed by him, (I am sure you will not pass it without a visit, experienced as you are in the work; for I have been told that you support one of the hospitals at Amasea out of the substance wherewith the Lord has blessed you), I am confident that, after seeing it, you will give him all he asks.

[143:6] Your colleague has already promised me some help towards the hospitals.

[143:7] I tell you this, not that you may imitate him, for you are likely to be a leader of others in good works, but that you may know that others have shown regard for me in this matter.

[144:1] Letter CXLIV.

[144:2] To the prefects' officer.

[144:3] You know the bearer from meeting him in the town.

[144:4] Nevertheless I write to commend him to you, that he may be useful to you in many matters in which you are interested, from his being able to give pious and sensible advice.

[144:5] Now is the time to carry out what you have said to me in private; I mean when this my brother has told you the state of the poor.

[145:1] Letter CXLV.

[145:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[145:3] I know the countless labours which you have undergone for the Churches of God; I know your press of occupation, while you discharge your responsibilities, not as though they were of mere secondary importance, but in accordance with God's will.

[145:4] I know the man who is, as it were, laying close siege to you and by whom you are forced, like birds crouching in cover under an eagle, not to go far from your shelter.

[145:5] I know all this.

[145:6] But longing is strong, both in hoping for the impracticable and attempting the impossible.

[145:7] Rather I should say, hope in God is the strongest of all things.

[145:8] For it is not from unreasonable desire, but from strength of faith, that I expect a way out, even from the greatest difficulties, and that you will find a way to get over all hindrances, and to come to see the Church that loves you best of all, and to be seen by her.

[145:9] What she values most of all good things is to behold your face and to hear your voice.

[145:10] Beware then of making her hopes vain.

[145:11] When last year, on my return from Syria, I reported the promise which you had given me, you cannot think how elated with her hopes I made her.

[145:12] Do not, my friend, postpone your coming to another time.

[145:13] Even if it may be possible for you to see her one day, you may not see her and me too, for sickness is hurrying me on to quit this painful life.

[146:1] Letter CXLVI.

[146:2] To Antiochus.

[146:3] I cannot accuse you of carelessness and inattention, because, when an opportunity of writing occurred, you said nothing.

[146:4] For I count the greeting which you have sent me in your own honoured hand worth many letters.

[146:5] In return I salute you, and beg you earnestly to give heed to the salvation of your soul, disciplining all the lusts of the flesh by reason, and ever keeping the thought of God built up in your soul, as in a very holy temple.

[146:6] In every deed and every word hold before your eyes the judgment of Christ, so that every individual action, being referred to that exact and awful examination may bring you glory in the day of retribution, when you win praise from all creation.

[146:7] If that great man should be able to pay me a visit, it would be a pleasure to me to see you here with him.

[147:1] Letter CXLVII.

[147:2] To Aburgius.

[147:3] Up to this time I used to think Homer a fable, when I read the second part of his poem, in which he narrates the adventures of Ulysses.

[147:4] But the calamity which has befallen the most excellent Maximus has led me to look on what I used to think fabulous and incredible, as exceedingly probable.

[147:5] Maximus was governor of no insignificant people, just as Ulysses was chief of the Cephallenians.

[147:6] Ulysses had great wealth, and returned stripped of everything.

[147:7] To such straits has calamity reduced Maximus, that he may have to present himself at home in borrowed rags.

[147:8] And perhaps he has suffered all this because he has irritated some Laestrygones against him, and has fallen in with some Scylla, hiding a dog's fierceness and fury under a woman's form.

[147:9] Since then he has barely been able to swim out of this inextricable whirlpool.

[147:10] He supplicates you by my means for humanity's sake to grieve for his undeserved misfortunes and not be silent about his needs, but make them known to the authorities.

[147:11] He hopes thus that he may find some aid against the slanders which have been got up against him: and if not, that at all events the intention of the enemy who has shewn such an intoxication of hostility against him may be made public.

[147:12] When a man has been wronged it is a considerable comfort to him if the wickedness of his enemies can be made plain.

[148:1] Letter CXLVIII.

[148:2] To Trajan.

[148:3] Even the ability to bewail their own calamities brings much comfort to the distressed; and this is specially the case when they meet with others capable, from their lofty character, of sympathizing with their sorrows.

[148:4] So my right honourable brother Maximus, after being prefect of my country, and then suffering what no other man ever yet suffered, stripped of all his belongings both inherited from his forefathers and collected by his own labours, afflicted in body in many and various ways, by his wanderings up and down the world, and not having been able to keep even his civil status free from attack, to preserve which freemen are wont to leave no labour undone, has made many complaints to me about all that has happened to him, and has begged me to give you a short description of the Iliad of woes in which he is involved.

[148:5] And I, being quite unable to relieve him in any other way in his troubles, have readily done him the favour shortly to relate to your excellency a part of what I have heard from him.

[148:6] He, indeed, seemed to me to blush at the idea of making a plain tale of his own calamity.

[148:7] If what has happened shews that the inflicter of the wrong is a villain, at all events it proves the sufferer to be deserving of great pity; since the very fact of having fallen into troubles inflicted by Divine Providence, seems in a manner to shew that a man has been devoted to suffering.

[148:8] But it would be a sufficient comfort to him if you will only look at him kindly, and extend also to him that abundant favour which all the recipients of it cannot exhaust,—I mean your clemency.

[148:9] We are all of us convinced that before the tribunal your protection will be an immense step towards victory.

[148:10] He who has asked for my letter as likely to be of service is of all men most upright.

[148:11] May it be granted me to see him, with the rest, proclaiming aloud the praises of your lordship with all his power.

[149:1] Letter CXLIX.

[149:2] To Trajan.

[149:3] You yourself have seen with your own eyes the distressing condition of Maximus, once a man of high reputation, but now most of all to be pitied, formerly prefect of my country.

[149:4] Would that he had never been so! Many, I think, would be likely to shun provincial governorships, if their dignities are likely to issue in such an end.

[149:5] To a man, then, from the quickness of his intelligence, able from a few circumstances to conjecture the rest, I need hardly narrate in detail all that I have seen and all that I have heard.

[149:6] Perhaps, however, I shall not seem to be telling a superfluous story if I mention that, though many and terrible things were audaciously done against him before your coming, what went on afterwards was such as to cause the former proceedings to be reckoned as kindness; to such an excess of outrage and injury and actually of personal cruelty did the proceedings go which were afterwards taken against him by the person in authority.

[149:7] Now he is here with an escort to fill up the measure of his evil deeds unless you are willing to stretch out your strong hand to protect the sufferer.

[149:8] In urging your goodness to an act of kindness I feel that I am undertaking an unnecessary task.

[149:9] Yet since I desire to be serviceable to Maximus I do beg your lordship to add something for my sake to your natural zeal for what is right, to the end that he may clearly perceive that my intervention on his behalf has been of service to him.

[150:1] Letter CL.

[150:2] To Amphilochius in the name of Heraclidas.

[150:3] 1.

[150:4] I remember our old conversations with one another, and am forgetful neither of what I said, nor of what you said.

[150:5] And now public life has no hold upon me.

[150:6] For although I am the same in heart and have not yet put off the old man, nevertheless, outwardly and by withdrawing myself far from worldly life, I seem already to have begun to tread the way of Christian conversation.

[150:7] I sit apart, like men who are on the point of embarking on the deep, looking out at what is before me.

[150:8] Mariners, indeed, need winds to make their voyage prosperous; I on the other hand want a guide to take me by the hand and conduct me safely through life's bitter waves.

[150:9] I feel that I need first a curb for my young manhood, and then pricks to drive me to the course of piety.

[150:10] Both these seem to be provided by reason, which at one time disciplines my unruliness of soul, and at another time my sluggishness.

[150:11] Again I want other remedies that I may wash off the impurity of habit.

[150:12] You know how, long accustomed as I was to the Forum, I am lavish of words, and do not guard myself against the thoughts put into my mind by the evil one.

[150:13] I am the servant too of honour, and cannot easily give up thinking great things of myself.

[150:14] Against all this I feel that I need a great instructor.

[150:15] Then, further, I conclude that it is of no small importance, nor of benefit only for a little while, that the soul's eye should be so purged that, after being freed from all the darkness of ignorance, as though from some blinding humour, one can gaze intently on the beauty of the glory of God.

[150:16] All this I know very well that your wisdom is aware of; I know that you would wish that I might have some one to give me such help, and if ever God grant me to meet you I am sure that I shall learn more about what I ought to heed.

[150:17] For now, in my great ignorance, I can hardly even form a judgment as to what I lack.

[150:18] Yet I do not repent of my first impulse; my soul does not hang back from the purpose of a godly life as you have feared for me, nobly and becomingly doing everything in your power, lest, like the woman of whom I have heard the story, I should turn back and become a pillar of salt.

[150:19] I am still, however, under the restraint of external authority; for the magistrates are seeking me like a deserter.

[150:20] But I am chiefly influenced by my own heart, which testifies to itself of all that I have told you.

[150:21] 2.

[150:22] Since you have mentioned our bond, and have announced that you mean to prosecute, you have made me laugh in this my dejection, because you are still an advocate and do not give up your shrewdness.

[150:23] I hold, unless, indeed, like an ignorant man, I am quite missing the truth, that there is only one way to the Lord, and that all who are journeying to Him are travelling together and walking in accordance with one "bond" of life.

[150:24] If this be so, wherever I go how can I be separated from you? How can I cease to live with you, and with you serve God, to Whom we have both fled for refuge? Our bodies may be separated by distance, but God's eye still doubtless looks upon us both; if indeed a life like mine is fit to be beheld by the divine eyes; for I have read somewhere in the Psalms that the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous.

[150:25] I do indeed pray that with you and with all that are like minded with you, I may be associated, even in body, and that night and day with you and with any other true worshipper of God I may bow my knees to our Father which is in heaven; for I know that communion in prayer brings great gain.

[150:26] If, as often as it is my lot to lie and groan in a different corner, I am always to be accused of lying, I cannot contend against your argument, and already condemn myself as a liar, if with my own carelessness I have said anything which brings me under such a charge.

[150:27] 3.

[150:28] I was lately at Caesarea, in order to learn what was going on there.

[150:29] I was unwilling to remain in the city itself, and betook myself to the neighbouring hospital, that I might get there what information I wanted.

[150:30] According to his custom the very godly bishop visited it, and I consulted him as to the points which you had urged upon me.

[150:31] It is not possible for me to remember all that he said in reply; it went far beyond the limits of a letter.

[150:32] In sum, however, what he said about poverty was this, that the rule ought to be that every one should limit his possessions to one garment.

[150:33] For one proof of this he quoted the words of John the Baptist "he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none;" and for another our Lord's prohibition to His disciples to have two coats.

[150:34] He further added "If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor".

[150:35] He said too that the parable of the pearl bore on this point, because the merchant, who had found the pearl of great price, went away and sold all that he had and bought it; and he added too that no one ought even to permit himself the distribution of his own property, but should leave it in the hands of the person entrusted with the duty of managing the affairs of the poor; and he proved the point from the acts of the apostles, because they sold their property and brought and laid it at the feet of the apostles, and by them it was distributed to each as every man had need.

[150:36] For he said that experience was needed in order to distinguish between cases of genuine need and of mere greedy begging.

[150:37] For whoever gives to the afflicted gives to the Lord, and from the Lord shall have his reward; but he who gives to every vagabond casts to a dog, a nuisance indeed from his importunity, but deserving no pity on the ground of want.

[150:38] 4.

[150:39] He was moreover the first to speak shortly, as befits the importance of the subject, about some of the daily duties of life.

[150:40] As to this I should wish you to hear from himself, for it would not be right for me to weaken the force of his lessons.

[150:41] I would pray that we might visit him together, that so you might both accurately preserve in your memory what he said, and supply any omissions by your own intelligence.

[150:42] One thing that I do remember, out of the many which I heard, is this; that instruction how to lead the Christian life depends less on words, than on daily example.

[150:43] I know that, if you had not been detained by the duty of succouring your aged father, there is nothing that you would have more greatly esteemed than a meeting with the bishop, and that you would not have advised me to leave him in order to wander in deserts.

[150:44] Caves and rocks are always ready for us, but the help we get from our fellow man is not always at hand.

[150:45] If, then, you will put up with my giving you advice, you will impress on your father the desirability of his allowing you to leave him for a little while in order to meet a man who, alike from his experience of others and from his own wisdom, knows much, and is able to impart it to all who approach him.

[151:1] Letter CLI.

[151:2] To Eustathius the Physician.

[151:3] If my letters are of any good, lose no time in writing to me and in rousing me to write.

[151:4] We are unquestionably made more cheerful when we read the letters of wise men who love the Lord.

[151:5] It is for you to say, who read it, whether you find anything worth attention in what I write.

[151:6] Were it not for the multitude of my engagements, I should not debar myself from the pleasure of writing frequently.

[151:7] Pray do you, whose cares are fewer, soothe me by your letters.

[151:8] Wells, it is said, are the better for being used.

[151:9] The exhortations which you derive from your profession are apparently beside the point, for it is not I who am applying the knife; it is men whose day is done, who are falling upon themselves.

[151:10] The phrase of the Stoics runs, "since things do not happen as we like, we like what happens;" but I cannot make my mind fall in with what is happening.

[151:11] That some men should do what they do not like because they cannot help it, I have no objection.

[151:12] You doctors do not cauterise a sick man, or make him suffer pain in some other way, because you like it; but you often adopt this treatment in obedience to the necessity of the case.

[151:13] Mariners do not willingly throw their cargo overboard; but in order to escape shipwreck they put up with the loss, preferring a life of penury to death.

[151:14] Be sure that I look with sorrow and with many groans upon the separation of those who are holding themselves aloof.

[151:15] But yet I endure it.

[151:16] To lovers of the truth nothing can be put before God and hope in Him.

[152:1] Letter CLII.

[152:2] To Victor, the Commander.

[152:3] If I were to fail to write to any one else I might possibly with justice incur the charge of carelessness or forgetfulness.

[152:4] But it is not possible to forget you, when your name is in all men's mouths.

[152:5] But I cannot be careless about one who is perhaps more distinguished than any one else in the empire.

[152:6] The cause of my silence is evident.

[152:7] I am afraid of troubling so great a man.

[152:8] If, however, to all your other virtues you add that of not only receiving what I send, but of actually asking after what is missing, lo! here I am writing to you with joyous heart, and I shall go on writing for the future, with prayers to God that you may be requited for the honour you pay me.

[152:9] For the Church, you have anticipated my supplications, by doing everything which I should have asked.

[152:10] And you act to please not man but God, Who has honoured you; Who has given you some good things in this life, and will give you others in the life to come, because you have walked with truth in His way, and, from the beginning to the end, have kept your heart fixed in the right faith.

[153:1] Letter CLIII.

[153:2] To Victor the Ex-Consul.

[153:3] As often as it falls to my lot to read your lordship's letters, so often do I thank God that you continue to remember me, and that you are not moved by any calumny to lessen the love which once you consented to entertain for me, either from your wise judgment or your kindly intercourse.

[153:4] I pray then the holy God that you may remain in this mind towards me, and that I may be worthy of the honour which you give me.

[154:1] Letter CLIV.

[154:2] To Ascholius, bishop of Thessalonica.

[154:3] You have done well, and in accordance with the law of spiritual love, in writing to me first, and by your good example challenging me to like energy.

[154:4] The friendship of the world, indeed, stands in need of actual sight and intercourse, that thence intimacy may begin.

[154:5] All, however, who know how to love in the spirit do not need the flesh to promote affection, but are led to spiritual communion in the fellowship of the faith.

[154:6] Thanks, then, to the Lord Who has comforted my heart by showing me that love has not grown cold in all, but that there are yet in the world men who show the evidence of the discipleship of Christ.

[154:7] The state of affairs with you seems to be something like that of the stars by night, shining some in one part of the sky and some in another, whereof the brightness is charming, and the more charming because it is unexpected.

[154:8] Such are you, luminaries of the Churches, a few at most and easily counted in this gloomy state of things, shining as in a moonless night, and, besides being welcome for your virtue, being all the more longed for because of its being so seldom that you are found.

[154:9] Your letter has made your disposition quite plain to me.

[154:10] Although small, as far as regards the number of its syllables, in the correctness of its sentiments it was quite enough to give me proof of your mind and purpose.

[154:11] Your zeal for the cause of the blessed Athanasius is plain proof of your being sound as to the most important matters.

[154:12] In return for my joy at your letter I am exceedingly grateful to my honourable son Euphemius, to whom I pray that all help may be given by the Holy One, and I beg you to join in my prayers that we may soon receive him back with his very honourable wife, my daughter in the Lord.

[154:13] As to yourself, I beg that you will not stay our joy at its beginning, but that you will write on every possible opportunity, and increase your good feeling towards me by constant communication.

[154:14] Give me news, I beg you, about your Churches and how they are situated as regards union.

[154:15] Pray for us here that our Lord may rebuke the winds and the sea, and that with us there may be a great, calm.

[155:1] Letter CLV.

[155:2] Without address.

[155:3] In the case of a trainer.

[155:4] I am at a loss how to defend myself against all the complaints contained in the first and only letter which your lordship has been so good as to send me.

[155:5] It is not that there is any lack of right on my side, but because among so many charges it is hard to select the most vital, and fix on the point at which I ought to begin to apply a remedy.

[155:6] Perhaps, if I follow the order of your letter, I shall come upon each in turn.

[155:7] Up to to-day I knew nothing about those who are setting out for Scythia; nor had any one told me even of those who came from your house, so that I might greet you by them, although I am anxious to seize every opportunity of greeting your lordship.

[155:8] To forget you in my prayers is impossible, unless first I forget the work to which God has called me, for assuredly, faithful as by God's grace you are, you remember all the prayers of the Church; how we pray also for our brethren when on a journey and offer prayer in the holy church for those who are in the army, and for those who speak for the sake of the Lord's name, and for those who show the fruits of the Spirit.

[155:9] In most, or all of these, I reckon your lordship to be included.

[155:10] How could I ever forget you, as far as I am individually concerned, when I have so many reasons to stir me to recollection, such a sister, such nephews, such kinsfolk, so good, so fond of me, house, household, and friends? By all these, even against my will, I am perforce reminded of your good disposition.

[155:11] As to this, however, our brother has brought me no unpleasant news, nor has any decision been come to by me which could do him any injury.

[155:12] Free, then, the chorepiscopus and myself from all blame, and grieve rather over those who have made false reports.

[155:13] If our learned friend wishes to bring an action against me, he has law courts and laws.

[155:14] In this I beg you not to blame me.

[155:15] In all the good deeds that you do, you are laying up treasure for yourself; you are preparing for yourself in the day of retribution the same refreshment which you are providing for those who are persecuted for the sake of the name of the Lord.

[155:16] If you send the relics of the martyrs home you will do well; as you write that the persecution there is, even now, causing martyrs to the Lord.

[156:1] Letter CLVI.

[156:2] To the Presbyter Evagrius.

[156:3] 1.

[156:4] So far from being impatient at the length of your letter, I assure you I thought it even short, from the pleasure it gave me when reading it.

[156:5] For is there anything more pleasing than the idea of peace? Is anything more suitable to the sacred office, or more acceptable to the Lord, than to take measures for effecting it? May you have the reward of the peace-maker, since so blessed an office has been the object of your good desires and earnest efforts.

[156:6] At the same time, believe me, my revered friend, I will yield to none in my earnest wish and prayer to see the day when those who are one in sentiment shall all fill the same assembly.

[156:7] Indeed it would be monstrous to feel pleasure in the schisms and divisions of the Churches, and not to consider that the greatest of goods consists in the knitting together of the members of Christ's body.

[156:8] But, alas! my inability is as real as my desire.

[156:9] No one knows better than yourself, that time alone is the remedy of ills that time has matured.

[156:10] Besides, a strong and vigorous treatment is necessary to get at the root of the complaint.

[156:11] You will understand this hint, though there is no reason why I should not speak out.

[156:12] 2.

[156:13] Self-importance, when rooted by habit in the mind, cannot be destroyed by one man, by one single letter, or in a short time.

[156:14] Unless there be some arbiter in whom all parties have confidence, suspicions and collisions will never altogether cease.

[156:15] If, indeed, the influence of Divine grace were shed upon me, and I were given power in word and deed and spiritual gifts to prevail with these rival parties, then this daring experiment might be demanded of me; though, perhaps, even then, you would not advise me to attempt this adjustment of things by myself, without the co-operation of the bishop, on whom principally falls the care of the church.

[156:16] But he cannot come hither, nor can I easily undertake a long journey while the winter lasts, or rather I cannot anyhow, for the Armenian mountains will be soon impassable, even to the young and vigorous, to say nothing of my continued bodily ailments.

[156:17] I have no objection to write to tell him of all this; but I have no expectation that writing will lead to anything, for I know his cautious character, and after all written words have little power to convince the mind.

[156:18] There are so many things to urge, and to bear, and to reply to, and to object, that a letter has no soul, and is in fact but waste paper.

[156:19] However, as I have said, I will write.

[156:20] Only give me credit, most religious and dear brother, for having no private feeling in the matter.

[156:21] Thank God.

[156:22] I have no such feeling towards any one.

[156:23] I have not busied myself in the investigation of the supposed or real complaints which are brought against this or that man; so my opinion has a claim on your attention as that of one who really cannot act from partiality or prejudice.

[156:24] I only desire, through the Lord's good will, that all things may be done with ecclesiastical propriety.

[156:25] 3.

[156:26] I was vexed to find from my dear son Dorotheus, our associate in the ministry, that you had been unwilling to communicate with him.

[156:27] This was not the kind of conversation which you had with me, as well as I recollect.

[156:28] As to my sending to the West it is quite out of the question.

[156:29] I have no one fit for the service.

[156:30] Indeed, when I look round, I seem to have no one on my side.

[156:31] I can but pray I may be found in the number of those seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

[156:32] I know the present persecutors of us all seek my life; yet that shall not diminish ought of the zeal which I owe to the Churches of God.

[157:1] Letter CLVII.

[157:2] To Amiochus.

[157:3] You may well imagine how disappointed I was not to meet you in the summer; not that our meeting in former years was enough to satisfy me, but even to see loved objects in a dream brings those who love some comfort.

[157:4] But you do not even write, so sluggish are you, and I think your absence can be referred to no other cause than that you are slow to undertake journeys for affection's sake.

[157:5] On this point I will say no more.

[157:6] Pray for me, and ask the Lord not to desert me, but as He has brought me out of bygone temptations so also to deliver me from those that I await, for the glory of the name of Him in Whom I put my trust.

[158:1] Letter CLVIII.

[158:2] To Antiochus.

[158:3] My sins have prevented me from carrying out the wish to meet you, which I have long entertained.

[158:4] Let me apologise by letter for my absence, and beseech you not to omit to remember me in your prayers, that, if I live, I may be permitted to enjoy your society.

[158:5] If not, by the aid of your prayers may I quit this world with good hope.

[158:6] I commend to you our brother the camel-master.

[159:1] Letter CLIX.

[159:2] To Eupaterius and his daughter.

[159:3] 1.

[159:4] You may well imagine what pleasure the letter of your excellencies gave me, if only from its very contents.

[159:5] What, indeed, could give greater gratification to one who prays ever to be in communication with them who fear the Lord, and to share their blessings, than a letter of this kind, wherein questions are asked about the knowledge of God? For if, to me, "to live is Christ,"truly my words ought to be about Christ, my every thought and deed ought to depend upon His commandments, and my soul to be fashioned after His.

[159:6] I rejoice, therefore, at being asked about such things, and congratulate the askers.

[159:7] By me, to speak shortly, the faith of the Fathers assembled at Nicaea is honoured before all later inventions.

[159:8] In it the Son is confessed to be con-substantial with the Father and to be naturally of the same nature with Him who begat Him, for He was confessed to be Light of Light, God of God, and Good of Good, and the like.

[159:9] Both by those holy men the same doctrine was declared, and by me now who pray that I may walk in their footsteps.

[159:10] 2.

[159:11] But since the question now raised by those who are always endeavouring to introduce novelties, but passed over in silence by the men of old, because the doctrine was never gainsaid, has remained without full explanation (I mean that which concerns the Holy Ghost) I will add a statement on this subject in conformity with the sense of Scripture.

[159:12] As we were baptized, so we profess our belief.

[159:13] As we profess our belief, so also we offer praise.

[159:14] As then baptism has been given us by the Saviour, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, so, in accordance with our baptism, we make the confession of the creed, and our doxology in accordance with our creed.

[159:15] We glorify the Holy Ghost together with the Father and the Son, from the conviction that He is not separated from the Divine Nature; for that which is foreign by nature does not share in the same honors.

[159:16] All who call the Holy Ghost a creature we pity, on the ground that, by this utterance, they are falling into the unpardonable sin of blasphemy against Him.

[159:17] I need use no argument to prove to those who are even slightly trained in Scripture, that the creature is separated from the Godhead.

[159:18] The creature is a slave; but the Spirit sets free.

[159:19] The creature needs life; the Spirit is the Giver of life.

[159:20] The creature requires teaching.

[159:21] It is the Spirit that teaches.

[159:22] The creature is sanctified; it is the Spirit that sanctifies.

[159:23] Whether you name angels, archangels, or all the heavenly powers, they receive their sanctification through the Spirit, but the Spirit Himself has His holiness by nature, not received by favour, but essentially His; whence He has received the distinctive name of Holy.

[159:24] What then is by nature holy, as the Father is by nature holy, and the Son by nature holy, we do not ourselves allow to be separated and severed from the divine and blessed Trinity, nor accept those who rashly reckon it as part of creation.

[159:25] Let this short summary be sufficient for you, my pious friends.

[159:26] From little seeds, with the co-operation of the Holy Ghost, you will reap the fuller crop of piety.

[159:27] "Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser".

[159:28] I will put off fuller demonstration till we meet.

[159:29] When we do, it will be possible for me to answer objections, to give you fuller proofs from Scripture, and to confirm all the sound rule of faith.

[159:30] For the present pardon my brevity.

[159:31] I should not have written at all had I not thought it a greater injury to you to refuse your request altogether than to grant it in part.

[160:1] Letter CLX.

[160:2] To Diodorus.

[160:3] 1.

[160:4] I have received the letter which has reached me under the name of Diodorus, but in what it contains creditable to any one rather than to Diodorus.

[160:5] Some ingenious person seems to have assumed your name, with the intention of getting credit with his hearers.

[160:6] It appears that he was asked by some one if it was lawful to contract marriage with his deceased wife's sister; and, instead of shuddering at such a question, he heard it unmoved, and quite boldly and bravely supported the unseemly desire.

[160:7] Had I his letter by me I would have sent it you, and you would have been able to defend both yourself and the truth.

[160:8] But the person who showed it me took it away again, and carried it about as a kind of trophy of triumph against me who had forbidden it from the beginning, declaring that he had permission in writing.

[160:9] Now I have written to you that I may attack that spurious document with double strength, and leave it no force whereby it may injure its readers.

[160:10] 2.

[160:11] First of all I have to urge, what is of most importance in such matters, our own custom, which has the force of law, because the rules have been handed down to us by holy men.

[160:12] It is as follows: if any one, overcome by impurity, falls into unlawful intercourse with two sisters, this is not to be looked upon as marriage, nor are they to be admitted at all into the Church until they have separated from one another.

[160:13] Wherefore, although it were possible to say nothing further, the custom would be quite enough to safeguard what is right.

[160:14] But, since the writer of the letter has endeavoured to introduce this mischief into our practice by a false argument, I am under the necessity of not omitting the aid of reasoning; although in matters which are perfectly plain every man's instinctive sentiment is stronger than argument.

[160:15] 3.

[160:16] It is written, he says, in Leviticus "Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time".

[160:17] From this it is plain, he argues, that it is lawful to take her when the wife is dead.

[160:18] To this my first answer shall be, that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law; otherwise we shall be subject to circumcision, the sabbath, abstinence from meats.

[160:19] For we certainly must not, when we find anything which falls in with our pleasures, subject ourselves to the yoke of slavery to the law; and then, if anything in the law seems hard, have recourse to the freedom which is in Christ.

[160:20] We have been asked if it is written that one may be taken to wife after her sister.

[160:21] Let us say what is safe and true, that it is not written.

[160:22] But to deduce by sequence of argument what is passed over in silence is the part of a legislator, not of one who quotes the articles of the law.

[160:23] Indeed, on these terms, any one who likes will be at liberty to take the sister, even in the lifetime of the wife.

[160:24] The same sophism fits in this case also.

[160:25] It is written, he says, "Thou shalt not take a wife to vex her:" so that, apart from vexation, there is no prohibition to take her.

[160:26] The man who wants to indulge his desire will maintain that the relationship of sisters is such that they cannot vex one another.

[160:27] Take away the reason given for the prohibition to live with both, and what is there to prevent a man's taking both sisters? This is not written, we shall say.

[160:28] Neither is the former distinctly stated.

[160:29] The deduction from the argument allows liberty in both cases.

[160:30] But a solution of the difficulty might be found by going a little back to what is behind the enactment.

[160:31] It appears that the legislator does not include every kind of sin, but particularly prohibits those of the Egyptians, from among whom Israel had gone forth, and of the Canaanites among whom they were going.

[160:32] The words are as follows, "After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances".

[160:33] It is probable that this kind of sin was not practised at that time among the Gentiles.

[160:34] Under these circumstances the lawgiver was, it may be supposed, under no necessity of guarding against it; the unwritten custom sufficed to condemn the crime.

[160:35] How then is it that while forbidding the greater he was silent about the less? Because the example of the patriarch seemed injurious to many who indulged their flesh so far as to live with sisters in their life time.

[160:36] What ought to be my course? To quote the Scriptures, or to work out what they leave unsaid? In these laws it is not written that a father and son ought not to have the same concubine, but, in the prophet, it is thought deserving of the most extreme condemnation, "A man and his father" it is said "will go in unto the same maid".

[160:37] And how many other forms of unclean lust have been found out in the devils' school, while divine scripture is silent about them, not choosing to befoul its dignity with the names of filthy things and condemning their uncleanness in general terms! As the apostle Paul says, "Fornication and all uncleanness…let it not be once named among you as becometh saints," thus including the unspeakable doings of both males and females under the name of uncleanness.

[160:38] It follows that silence certainly does not give license to voluptuaries.

[160:39] 4.

[160:40] I, however, maintain that this point has not been left in silence, but that the lawgiver has made a distinct prohibition.

[160:41] The words "None of you shall approach to any one that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness," embraces also this form of kinsmanship, for what could be more akin to a man than his own wife, or rather than his own flesh? "For they are no more twain but one flesh".

[160:42] So, through the wife, the sister is made akin to the husband.

[160:43] For as he shall not take his wife's mother, nor yet his wife's daughter, because he may not take his own mother nor his own daughter, so he may not take his wife's sister, because he may not take his own sister.

[160:44] And, on the other hand, it will not be lawful for the wife to be joined with the husband's kin, for the rights of relationship hold good on both sides.

[160:45] But, for my part, to every one who is thinking about marriage I testify that, "the fashion of this world passeth away," and the time is short: "it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none".

[160:46] If he improperly quotes the charge "Increase and multiply," I laugh at him, for not discerning the signs of the times.

[160:47] Second marriage is a remedy against fornication, not a means of lasciviousness.

[160:48] "If they cannot contain," it is said "let them marry;" but if they marry they must not break the law.

[160:49] 5.

[160:50] But they whose souls are blinded by dishonourable lust do not regard even nature, which from old time distinguished the names of the family.

[160:51] For under what relationship will those who contract these unions name their sons? Will they call them brothers or cousins of one another? For, on account of the confusion, both names will apply.

[160:52] O man, do not make the aunt the little one's stepmother; do not arm with implacable jealousy her who ought to cherish them with a mother's love.

[160:53] It is only stepmothers who extend their hatred even beyond death; other enemies make a truce with the dead; stepmothers begin their hatred after death.

[160:54] The sum of what I say is this.

[160:55] If any one wants to contract a lawful marriage, the whole world is open to him: if he is only impelled by lust, let him be the more restricted, "that he may know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour, not in the lust of concupiscence".

[160:56] I should like to say more, but the limits of my letter leave me no further room.

[160:57] I pray that my exhortation may prove stronger than lust, or at least that this pollution may not be found in my own province.

[160:58] Where it has been ventured on there let it abide.

[161:1] Letter CLXI.

[161:2] To Amphilochius on his consecration as Bishop.

[161:3] 1.

[161:4] Blessed be God Who from age to age chooses them that please Him, distinguishes vessels of election, and uses them for the ministry of the Saints.

[161:5] Though you were trying to flee, as you confess, not from me, but from the calling you expected through me, He has netted you in the sure meshes of grace, and has brought you into the midst of Pisidia to catch men for the Lord, and draw the devil's prey from the deep into the light.

[161:6] You, too, may say as the blessed David said, "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence".

[161:7] Such is the wonderful work of our loving Master.

[161:8] "Asses are lost" that there may be a king of Israel.

[161:9] David, however, being an Israelite was granted to Israel; but the land which has nursed you and brought you to such a height of virtue, possesses you no longer, and sees her neighbour beautified by her own adornment.

[161:10] But all believers in Christ are one people; all Christ's people, although He is hailed from many regions, are one Church; and so our country is glad and rejoices at the dispensation of the Lord, and instead of thinking that she is one man the poorer, considers that through one man she has become possessed of whole Churches.

[161:11] Only may the Lord grant me both to see you in person, and, so long as I am parted from you, to hear of your progress in the gospel, and of the good order of your Churches.

[161:12] 2.

[161:13] Play the man, then, and be strong, and walk before the people whom the Most High has entrusted to your hand.

[161:14] Like a skilful pilot, rise in mind above every wave lifted by heretical blasts; keep the boat from being whelmed by the salt and bitter billows of false doctrine; and wait for the calm to be made by the Lord so soon as there shall have been found a voice worthy of rousing Him to rebuke the winds and the sea.

[161:15] If you wish to visit me, now hurried by long sickness towards the inevitable end, do not wait for an opportunity, or for the word from me.

[161:16] You know that to a father's heart every time is suitable to embrace a well-loved son, and that affection is stronger than words.

[161:17] Do not lament over a responsibility transcending your strength.

[161:18] If you had been destined to bear the burden unaided, it would have been not merely heavy; it would have been intolerable.

[161:19] But if the Lord shares the load with you, "cast all your care upon the Lord" and He will Himself act.

[161:20] Only be exhorted ever to give heed lest you be carried away by wicked customs.

[161:21] Rather change all previous evil ways into good by the help of the wisdom given you by God.

[161:22] For Christ has sent you not to follow others, but yourself to take the lead of all who are being saved.

[161:23] I charge you to pray for me, that, if I am still in this life, I may be permitted to see you with your Church.

[161:24] If, however, it is ordained that I now depart, may I see all of you hereafter with the Lord, your Church blooming like a vine with good works, and yourself like a wise husbandman and good servant giving meat in due season to his fellow-servants and receiving the reward of a wise and trusty steward.

[161:25] All who are with me salute your reverence.

[161:26] May you be strong and joyful in the Lord.

[161:27] May you be preserved glorious in the graces of the Spirit and of wisdom.

[162:1] Letter CLXII.

[162:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[162:3] The same cause seems to make me hesitate to write, and to prove that I must write.

[162:4] When I think of the visit which I owe, and reckon up the gain at meeting you, I cannot help despising letters, as being not even shadows in comparison with the reality.

[162:5] Then, again, when I reckon that my only consolation, deprived as I am of all that is best and most important, is to salute such a man and beg him, as I am wont, not to forget me in his prayers, I bethink me that letters are of no small value.

[162:6] I do not, myself, wish to give up all hope of my visit, nor to despair of seeing you.

[162:7] I should be ashamed not to seem to put so much confidence in your prayers as even to expect to be turned from an old man into a young one, if such a need were to arise, and not merely from a sick and emaciated one, as I am now, into one a little bit stronger.

[162:8] It is not easy to express in words the reason of my not being with you already, because I am not only prevented by actual illness, but have not even force of speech enough at any time to give you an account of such manifold and complex disease.

[162:9] I can only say that, ever since Easter up to now, fever, diarrhoea, and intestinal disturbance, drowning me like waves, do not suffer me to lift my head above them.

[162:10] Brother Barachus may be able to tell you the character of my symptoms, if not as their severity deserves, at least clearly enough to make you understand the reason of my delay.

[162:11] If you join cordially in my prayers, I have no doubt that my troubles will easily pass away.

[163:1] Letter CLXIII.

[163:2] To Count Jovinus.

[163:3] One can see your soul in your letter, for in reality no painter can so exactly catch an outward likeness, as uttered thoughts can image the secrets of the soul.

[163:4] As I read your letter, your words exactly characterized your steadfastness, your real dignity, your unfailing sincerity; in all those things it comforted me greatly though I could not see you.

[163:5] Never fail, then, to seize every opportunity of writing to me, and to give me the pleasure of conversing with you at a distance; for to see you face to face I am now forbidden by the distressing state of my health.

[163:6] How serious this is you will learn from the God-beloved bishop Amphilochius, who is both able to report to you from his having been constantly with me, and fully competent to tell you what he has seen.

[163:7] But the only reason why I wish you to know of my sufferings is, that you will forgive me for the future, and acquit me of lack of energy, if I fail to come and see you, though in truth my loss does not so much need defence from me as comfort from you.

[163:8] Had it been possible for me to come to you, I should have very much preferred a sight of your excellency to all the ends that other men count worth an effort.

[164:1] Letter CLXIV.

[164:2] To Ascholius.

[164:3] 1.

[164:4] It would not be easy for me to say how very much delighted I am with your holiness's letter.

[164:5] My words are too weak to express all that I feel; you, however, ought to be able to conjecture it, from the beauty of what you have written.

[164:6] For what did not your letter contain? It contained love to God; the marvellous description of the martyrs, which put the manner of their good fight so plainly before me that I seemed actually to see it; love and kindness to myself; words of surpassing beauty.

[164:7] So when I had taken it into my hands, and read it many times, and perceived how abundantly full it was of the grace of the Spirit, I thought that I had gone back to the good old times, when God's Churches flourished, rooted in faith, united in love, all the members being in harmony, as though in one body.

[164:8] Then the persecutors were manifest, and manifest too the persecuted.

[164:9] Then the people grew more numerous by being attacked.

[164:10] Then the blood of the martyrs, watering the Churches, nourished many more champions of true religion, each generation stripping for the struggle with the zeal of those that had gone before.

[164:11] Then we Christians were in peace with one another, the peace which the Lord bequeathed us, of which, so cruelly have we driven it from among us, not a single trace is now left us.

[164:12] Yet my soul did go back to that blessedness of old, when a letter came from a long distance, bright with the beauty of love, and a martyr travelled to me from wild regions beyond the Danube, preaching in his own person the exactitude of the faith which is there observed.

[164:13] Who could tell the delight of my soul at all this? What power of speech could be devised competent to describe all that I felt in the bottom of my heart? However, when I saw the athlete, I blessed his trainer: he, too, before the just Judge, after strengthening many for the conflict on behalf of true religion, shall receive the crown of righteousness.

[164:14] 2.

[164:15] By bringing the blessed Eutyches to my recollection, and honouring my country for having sown the seeds of true religion, you have at once delighted me by your reminder of the past, and distressed me by your conviction of the present.

[164:16] None of us now comes near Eutyches in goodness: so far are we from bringing barbarians under the softening power of the Spirit, and the operation of His graces, that by the greatness of our sins we turn gentle hearted men into barbarians, for to ourselves and to our sins I attribute it that the influence of the heretics is so widely diffused.

[164:17] Peradventure no part of the world has escaped the conflagration of heresy.

[164:18] You tell me of struggles of athletes, bodies lacerated for the truth's sake, savage fury despised by men of fearless heart, various tortures of persecutors, and constancy of the wrestlers through them all, the block and the water whereby the martyrs died.

[164:19] And what is our condition? Love is grown cold; the teaching of the Fathers is being laid waste; everywhere is shipwreck of the Faith; the mouths of the Faithful are silent; the people, driven from the houses of prayer, lift up their hands in the open air to their Lord which is in heaven.

[164:20] Our afflictions are heavy, martyrdom is nowhere to be seen, because those who evilly entreat us are called by the same name as ourselves.

[164:21] Wherefore pray to the Lord yourself, and join all Christ's noble athletes with you in prayer for the Churches, to the end that, if any further time remains for this world, and all things are not being driven to destruction, God may be reconciled to his own Churches and restore them to their ancient peace.

[165:1] Letter CLXV.

[165:2] To Ascholius, bishop of Thessalonica.

[165:3] God has fulfilled my old prayer in deigning to allow me to receive the letter of your veritable holiness.

[165:4] What I most of all desire is to see you and to be seen by you, and to enjoy in actual intercourse all the graces of the Spirit with which you are endowed.

[165:5] This, however, is impossible, both on account of the distance which separates us, and the engrossing occupations of each of us.

[165:6] I therefore pray, in the second place, that my soul may be fed by frequent letters from your love in Christ.

[165:7] This has now been granted me on taking your epistle into my hands.

[165:8] I have been doubly delighted at the enjoyment of your communication.

[165:9] I felt as though I could really see your very soul shining in your words as in some mirror; and I was moved to exceeding joy, not only at your proving to be what all testimony says of you, but that your noble qualities are the ornament of my country.

[165:10] You have filled the country beyond our borders with spiritual fruits, like some vigorous branch sprung from a glorious root.

[165:11] Rightly, then, does our country rejoice in her own offshoots.

[165:12] When you were engaging in conflicts for the Faith she heard that the goodly heritage of the Fathers was preserved in you, and she glorified God.

[165:13] And now what are you about? You have honoured the land that gave you birth by sending her a martyr who has just fought a good fight in the barbarian country on your borders, just as a grateful gardener might send his first fruits to those who had given him the seeds.

[165:14] Verily the gift is worthy of Christ's athlete, a martyr of the truth just crowned with the crown of righteousness, whom we have gladly welcomed, glorifying God who has now fulfilled the gospel of His Christ in all the world.

[165:15] Let me ask you to remember in your prayers me who love you, and for my soul's sake earnestly to beseech the Lord that one day I, too, may be deemed worthy to begin to serve God, according to the way of His commandments which He has given us to salvation.

[166:1] Letter CLXVI.

[166:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[167:1] Letter CLXVII.

[167:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[167:3] I am delighted at your remembering me and writing, and, what is yet more important, at your sending me your blessing in your letter.

[167:4] Had I been but worthy of your labours and of your struggles in Christ's cause, I should have been permitted to come to you and embrace you, and to take you as a model of patience.

[167:5] But since I am not worthy of this, and am detained by many afflictions and much occupation, I do what is next best.

[167:6] I salute your excellency, and beseech you not to grow weary of remembering me.

[167:7] For the honour and pleasure of receiving your letters is not only an advantage to me, but it is a ground of boasting and pride before the world that I should be held in honour by one whose virtue is so great, and who is in such close communion with God as to be able, alike by his teaching and example, to unite others with him in it.

[168:1] Letter CLXVIII.

[168:2] To Antiochus.

[168:3] I mourn for the Church that is deprived of the guidance of such a shepherd.

[168:4] But I have so much the more ground for congratulating you on being worthy of the privilege of enjoying, at such a moment, the society of one who is fighting such a good fight in the cause of the truth, and I am sure that you, who nobly support and stimulate his zeal, will be thought worthy by the Lord of a lot like his.

[168:5] What a blessing, to enjoy in unbroken quiet the society of the man so rich in learning and experienced in life! Now, at least, you must, I am sure, know how wise he is.

[168:6] In days gone by his mind was necessarily given to many divided cares, and you were too busy a man to give your sole heed to the spiritual fountain which springs from his pure heart.

[168:7] God grant that you may be a comfort to him, and never yourself want consolation from others.

[168:8] I am sure of the disposition of your heart, alike from the experience which I, for a short time, have had of you, and from the exalted teaching your illustrious instructor, with whom to pass one single day is a sufficient provision for the journey to salvation.

[169:1] Letter CLXIX.

[169:2] Basil to Gregory.

[169:3] You have undertaken a kindly and charitable task in getting together the captive troop of the insolent Glycerius (at present I must so write), and, so far as in you lay, covering our common shame.

[169:4] It is only right that your reverence should undo this dishonour with a full knowledge of the facts about him.

[169:5] This grave and venerable Glycerius of yours was ordained by me deacon of the church of Venesa to serve the presbyter, and look after the work of the Church, for, though the fellow is in other respects intractable, he is naturally clever at manual labour.

[169:6] No sooner was he appointed than he neglected his work, as though there had been absolutely nothing to do.

[169:7] But, of his own private power and authority, he got together some wretched virgins, some of whom came to him of their own accord (you know how young people are prone to anything of this kind), and others were unwillingly forced to accept him as leader of their company.

[169:8] Then he assumed the style and title of patriarch, and began all of a sudden to play the man of dignity.

[169:9] He had not attained to this on any reasonable or pious ground; his only object was to get a means of livelihood, just as some men start one trade and some another.

[169:10] He has all but upset the whole Church, scorning his own presbyter, a man venerable both by character and age; scorning his chorepiscopus, and myself, as of no account at all, continually filling the town and all the clergy with disorder and disturbance.

[169:11] And now, on being mildly rebuked by me and his chorepiscopus, that he may not treat us with contempt (for he was trying to stir the younger men to like insubordination), he is meditating conduct most audacious and inhuman.

[169:12] After robbing as many of the virgins as he could, he has made off by night.

[169:13] I am sure all this will have seemed very sad to you.

[169:14] Think of the time too.

[169:15] The feast was being held there, and, as was natural, large numbers of people were gathered together.

[169:16] He, however, on his side, brought out his own troop, who followed young men and danced round them, causing all well-disposed persons to be most distressed, while loose chatterers laughed aloud.

[169:17] And even this was not enough, enormous as was the scandal.

[169:18] I am told that even the parents of the virgins, finding their bereavement unendurable, wishful to bring home the scattered company, and falling with not unnatural sighs and tears at their daughters' feet, have been insulted and outraged by this excellent young man and his troop of bandits.

[169:19] I am sure your reverence will think all this intolerable.

[169:20] The ridicule of it attaches to us all alike.

[169:21] First of all, order him to come back with the virgins.

[169:22] He might find some mercy, if he were to come back with a letter from you.

[169:23] If you do not adopt this course, at least send the virgins back to their mother the Church.

[169:24] If this cannot be done, at all events do not allow any violence to be done to those that are willing to return, but get them to return to me.

[169:25] Otherwise I call God and man to witness that all this is ill done, and a breach of the law of the Church.

[169:26] The best course would be for Glycerius to come back with a letter, and in a becoming and proper frame of mind; if not, let him be deprived of his ministry.

[170:1] Letter CLXX.

[170:2] To Glycerius.

[170:3] How far will your mad folly go? How long will you counsel mischief against yourself? How long will you go on rousing me to wrath, and bringing shame on the common order of solitaries? Return.

[170:4] Put confidence in God, and in me, who imitate God's loving-kindness.

[170:5] If I rebuked you like a father, like a father I will forgive you.

[170:6] This is the treatment you shall receive from me, for many others are making supplication in your behalf, and before all the rest your own presbyter, for whose grey hairs and compassionate disposition I feel much respect.

[170:7] Continue longer to hold aloof from me and you have quite fallen from your degree.

[170:8] You will also fall away from God, for with your songs and your garb you are leading the young women not to God, but to the pit.

[171:1] Letter CLXXI.

[171:2] To Gregory.

[171:3] I wrote to you, not long ago, about Glycerius and the virgins.

[171:4] Even now they have not returned, but are still hesitating, how and why I know not.

[171:5] I should be sorry to charge this against you, as though you were acting thus to bring discredit on me, either because you have some ground of complaint against me, or to gratify others.

[171:6] Let them then come, fearing nothing.

[171:7] Do you be surety for their doing this.

[171:8] For it pains me to have my members cut off, although they have been rightly cut off.

[171:9] If they hold out the burden will rest on others.

[171:10] I wash my hands of it.

[172:1] Letter CLXXII.

[172:2] To Sophronius, the bishop.

[172:3] There is no need for me to say how much I was delighted by your letter.

[172:4] Your own words will enable you to conjecture what I felt on receiving it.

[172:5] You have exhibited to me in your letter, the first fruits of the Spirit, love.

[172:6] Than this what can be more precious to me in the present state of affairs, when, because iniquity abounds, the love of many has waxed cold? Nothing is rarer now than spiritual intercourse with a brother, a word of peace, and such spiritual communion as I have found in you.

[172:7] For this I thank the Lord, beseeching Him that I may have part in the perfect joy that is found in you.

[172:8] If such be your letter, what must it be to meet you in person? If when you are far away you so affect me, what will you be to me when you are seen face to face? Be sure that if I had not been detained by innumerable occupations, and all the unavoidable anxieties which tie me down, I should have hurried to see your excellency.

[172:9] Although that old complaint of mine is a great hindrance to my moving about, nevertheless in view of the good I expect, I would not have allowed this to stand in my way.

[172:10] To be permitted to meet a man holding the same views and reverencing the faith of the Fathers, as you are said to do by our honourable brethren and fellow presbyters, is in truth to go back to the ancient blessedness of the Churches, when the sufferers from unsound disputation were few, and all lived in peace, "workmen" obeying the commandments and not "needing to be ashamed," serving the Lord with simple and clear confession, and keeping plain and inviolate their faith in Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

[173:1] Letter CLXXIII.

[173:2] To Theodora the Canoness.

[173:3] I should be more diligent in writing to you but for my belief that my letters do not always, my friend, reach your own hands.

[173:4] I am afraid that through the naughtiness of those on whose service I depend, especially at a time like this when the whole world is in a state of confusion, a great many other people get hold of them.

[173:5] So I wait to be found fault with, and to be eagerly asked for my letters, that so I may have this proof of their delivery.

[173:6] Yet, whether I write or not, one thing I do without failing, and that is to keep in my heart the memory of your excellency, and to pray the Lord to grant that you may complete the course of good living which you have chosen.

[173:7] For in truth it is no light thing for one, who makes a profession, to follow up all that the promise entails.

[173:8] Any one may embrace the gospel life, but only a very few of those who have come within my knowledge have completely carried out their duty in its minutest details, and have overlooked nothing that is contained therein.

[173:9] Only a very few have been consistent in keeping the tongue in check and the eye under guidance, as the Gospel would have it; in working with the hands according to the mark of doing what is pleasing to God; in moving the feet, and using every member, as the Creator ordained from the beginning.

[173:10] Propriety in dress, watchfulness in the society of men, moderation in eating and drinking, the avoidance of superfluity in the acquisition of necessities; all these things seem small enough when they are thus merely mentioned, but, as I have found by experience, their consistent observance requires no light struggle.

[173:11] Further, such a perfection of humility as not even to remember nobility of family, nor to be elevated by any natural advantage of body or mind which we may have, nor to allow other people's opinion of us to be a ground of pride and exaltation, all this belongs to the evangelic life.

[173:12] There is also sustained self-control, industry in prayer, sympathy in brotherly love, generosity to the poor, lowliness of temper, contrition of heart, soundness of faith, calmness in depression, while we never forget the terrible and inevitable tribunal.

[173:13] To that judgment we are all hastening, but those who remember it, and are anxious about what is to follow after it, are very few.

[174:1] Letter CLXXIV.

[174:2] To a Widow.

[174:3] I have been most wishful to write constantly to your excellency, but I have from time to time denied myself, for fear of causing any temptation to beset you, because of those who are ill disposed toward me.

[174:4] As I am told, their hatred has even gone so far that they make a fuss if any one happens to receive a letter from me.

[174:5] But now that you have begun to write yourself, and very good it is of you to do so, sending me needful information about all that is in your mind, I am stirred to write back to you.

[174:6] Let me then set right what has been omitted in the past, and at the same time reply to what your excellency has written.

[174:7] Truly blessed is the soul, which by night and by day has no other anxiety than how, when the great day comes wherein all creation shall stand before the Judge and shall give an account for its deeds, she too may be able easily to get quit of the reckoning of life.

[174:8] For he who keeps that day and that hour ever before him, and is ever meditating upon the defence to be made before the tribunal where no excuses will avail, will sin not at all, or not seriously, for we begin to sin when there is a lack of the fear of God in us.

[174:9] When men have a clear apprehension of what is threatened them, the awe inherent in them will never allow them to fall into inconsiderate action or thought.

[174:10] Be mindful therefore of God.

[174:11] Keep the fear of Him in your heart, and enlist all men to join with you in your prayers, for great is the aid of them that are able to move God by their importunity.

[174:12] Never cease to do this.

[174:13] Even while we are living this life in the flesh, prayer will be a mighty helper to us, and when we are departing hence it will be a sufficient provision for us on the journey to the world to come.

[174:14] Anxiety is a good thing; but, on the other hand, despondency, dejection, and despair of our salvation, are injurious to the soul.

[174:15] Trust therefore in the goodness of God, and look for His succour, knowing that if we turn to Him rightly and sincerely, not only will He not cast us off forever, but will say to us, even while we are in the act of uttering the words of our prayer, "Lo! I am with you".

[175:1] Letter CLXXV.

[175:2] To Count Magnenianus.

[175:3] Your excellency lately wrote to me, plainly charging me, besides other matters, to write concerning the Faith.

[175:4] I admire your zeal in the matter, and I pray God that your choice of good things may be persistent, and that, advancing in knowledge and good works, you may be made perfect.

[175:5] But I have no wish to leave behind me a treatise on the Faith, or to write various creeds, and so I have declined to send what you asked.

[175:6] You seem to me to be surrounded by the din of your men there, idle fellows, who say certain things to calumniate me, with the idea that they will improve their own position by lying disgracefully against me.

[175:7] The past shews what they are, and future experience will shew them in still plainer colours.

[175:8] I, however, call on all who trust in Christ not to busy themselves in opposition to the ancient faith, but, as we believe, so to be baptized, and, as we are baptized, so to offer the doxology.

[175:9] It is enough for us to confess those names which we have received from Holy Scripture, and to shun all innovation about them.

[175:10] Our salvation does not lie in the invention of modes of address, but in the sound confession of the Godhead in which we have professed our faith.

[176:1] Letter CLXXVI.

[176:2] To Amphilochius, Bishop of Iconium.

[176:3] God grant that when this letter is put into your hands, it may find you in good health, quite at leisure, and as you would wish to be.

[176:4] For then it will not be in vain that I send you this invitation to be present at our city, to add greater dignity to the annual festival which it is the custom of our Church to hold in honour of the martyrs.

[176:5] For be sure my most honoured and dear friend, that our people here, though they have had experience of many, desire no one's presence so eagerly as they do yours; so affectionate an impression has your short intercourse with them left behind.

[176:6] So, then, that the Lord may be glorified, the people delighted, the martyrs honoured, and that I in my old age may receive the attention due to me from my true son, do not refuse to travel to me with all speed.

[176:7] I will beg you too to anticipate the day of assembly, that so we may converse at leisure and may comfort one another by the interchange of spiritual gifts.

[176:8] The day is the fifth of September.

[176:9] Come then three days beforehand in order that you may also honour with your presence the Church of the Hospital.

[176:10] May you by the grace of the Lord be kept in good health and spirits in the Lord, praying for me and for the Church of God.

[177:1] Letter CLXXVII.

[177:2] To Saphronius the Master.

[177:3] To reckon up all those who have received kindness at your excellency's hand, for my sake, is no easy task; so many are there whom I feel that I have benefited through your kind aid, a boon which the Lord has given me to help me in these very serious times.

[177:4] Worthiest of all is he who is now introduced to you by my letter, the reverend brother Eusebius, attacked by a ridiculous calumny which it depends upon you alone in your uprightness, to destroy.

[177:5] I beseech you, therefore, both as respecting the right and as being humanely disposed, to grant me your accustomed favours, by adopting the cause of Eusebius as your own, and championing him, and, at the same time, truth.

[177:6] It is no small thing that he has the right on his side; and this, if he be not stricken down by the present crisis, he will have no difficulty in proving plainly and without possibility of contradiction.

[178:1] Letter CLXXVIII.

[178:2] To Aburgius.

[178:3] I know that I have often recommended many persons to your excellency, and so in serious emergencies have been very useful to friends in distress.

[178:4] But I do not think that I have ever sent to you one whom I regard with greater respect, or one engaged in contests of greater importance, than my very dear son Eusebius, who now places this letter in your hands.

[178:5] He will himself inform your excellency, if the opportunity is permitted him, in what difficulties he is involved.

[178:6] I ought to say, at least, as much as this.

[178:7] The man ought not to be misjudged, nor, because many have been convicted of disgraceful doings, ought he to come under common suspicion.

[178:8] He ought to have a fair trial, and his life must be enquired into.

[178:9] In this way the untruth of the charges against him will be made plain, and he, after enjoying your righteous protection, will ever proclaim what he owes to your kindness.

[179:1] Letter CLXXIX.

[179:2] To Arinthaeus.

[179:3] Your natural nobility of character and your general accessibility have taught me to regard you as a friend of freedom and of men.

[179:4] I have, therefore, no hesitation in approaching you in behalf of one who is rendered illustrious by a long line of ancestry, but is worthy of greater esteem and honour on his own account, because of his innate goodness of disposition.

[179:5] I beg you, on my entreaty, to give him your support under a legal charge, in reality, indeed, ridiculous, but difficult to meet on account of the seriousness of the accusation.

[179:6] It would be of great importance to his success if you would deign to say a kind word in his behalf.

[179:7] You would, in the first place, be helping the right; but you would further be showing in this your wonted respect and kindness to myself, who am your friend.

[180:1] Letter CLXXX.

[180:2] To the Master Sophronius, on behalf of Eunathius.

[180:3] I have been much distressed on meeting a worthy man involved in very great trouble.

[180:4] Being human, how could I fail to sympathise with a man of high character afflicted beyond his deserts? On thinking in what way I could be useful to him, I did find one means of helping him out of his difficulties, and that is by making him known to your excellency.

[180:5] It is now for you to extend also to him the same good offices which, as I can testify, you have shown to many.

[180:6] You will learn all the facts of the case from the petition presented by him to the emperors.

[180:7] This document I beg you to take into your hands, and implore you to help him to the utmost of your power.

[180:8] You will be helping a Christian, a gentleman, and one whose deep learning ought to win respect.

[180:9] If I add that in helping him you will confer a great kindness upon me, though, indeed, my interests are matters of small moment, yet, since you are always so good as to make them of importance, your boon to me will be no small one.

[181:1] Letter CLXXXI.

[181:2] To Otreius, bishop of Melitene.

[181:3] Your reverence is, I know, no less distressed than myself at the removal of the very God-beloved bishop Eusebius.

[181:4] We both of us need comfort.

[181:5] Let us try to give it to one another.

[181:6] Do you write to me what you hear from Samosata, and I will report to you anything that I may learn from Thrace.

[181:7] It is to me no slight alleviation of our present distress to know the constancy of the people.

[181:8] It will be the same to you to have news of our common father.

[181:9] Of course I cannot now tell you this by letter, but I commend to you one who is fully informed, and will report to you in what condition he left him, and how he bears his troubles.

[181:10] Pray, then, for him and for me that the Lord will grant him speedy release from his distress.

[182:1] Letter CLXXXII.

[182:2] To the presbyters of Samosata.

[182:3] Grieved as I am at the desolation of the Church, I none the less congratulate you on having been brought so soon to this extreme limit of your hard struggle.

[182:4] God grant that you may pass through it with patience, to the end that in return for your faithful stewardship, and the noble constancy which you have shewn in Christ's cause, you may receive the great reward.

[183:1] Letter CLXXXIII.

[183:2] To the Senate of Samosata.

[183:3] Seeing, as I do, that temptation is now spread all over the world, and that the greater cities of Syria have been tried by the same sufferings as yourselves, (though, indeed, nowhere is the Senate so approved and renowned for good works, as your own, noted as you are for your righteous zeal,) I all but thank the troubles which have befallen you.

[183:4] For had not this affliction come to pass, your proof under trial would never have been known.

[183:5] To all that earnestly strive for any good, the affliction they endure for the sake of their hope in God is like a furnace to gold.

[183:6] Rouse ye, then, most excellent sirs, that the labours you are about to undertake may not be unworthy of those which you have already sustained, and that on a firm foundation you may be seen putting a yet worthier finish.

[183:7] Rouse ye, that ye may stand round about the shepherd of the Church, when the Lord grants him to be seen on his own throne, telling each of you in his turn.

[183:8] some good deed done for the sake of the Church of God.

[183:9] On the great day of the Lord, each, according to the proportion of his labours, shall receive his recompense from the munificent Lord.

[183:10] By remembering me and writing to me as often as you can, you will be doing justice in sending me a reply, and will moreover give me very great pleasure, by sending me in writing a plain token of a voice which it is delightful to me to hear.

[184:1] Letter CLXXXIV.

[184:2] To Eustathius, bishop of Himmeria.

[184:3] Orphanhood is, I know, very dismal, and entails a great deal of work, because it deprives us of those who are set over us.

[184:4] Whence I conclude that you do not write to me, because you are depressed at what has happened to you, and at the same time are now very much occupied in visiting the folds of Christ, because they are attacked on every side by foes.

[184:5] But every grief finds consolation in communication with sympathising friends.

[184:6] Do then, I beg you, as often as you can, write to me.

[184:7] You will both refresh yourself by speaking to me, and you will comfort me by letting me hear from you.

[184:8] I shall endeavour to do the same to you, as often as my work lets me.

[184:9] Pray yourself, and entreat all the brotherhood earnestly to importune the Lord, to grant us one day release from the present distress.

[185:1] Letter CLXXXV.

[185:2] To Theodotus, bishop of Beraea.

[185:3] Although you do not write to me, I know that there is recollection of me in your heart; and this I infer, not because I am worthy of any favourable recollection, but because your soul is rich in abundance of love.

[185:4] Yet, as far as in you lies, use whatever opportunities you have of writing to me, to the end that I may both be cheered by hearing news of you, and have occasion to send you tidings of myself.

[185:5] This is the only mode of communication for those who live far apart.

[185:6] Do not let us deprive one another of it, so far as our labours will permit.

[185:7] But I pray God that we may meet in person, that our love may be increased, and that we may multiply gratitude to our Master for His greater boons.

[186:1] Letter CLXXXVI.

[186:2] To Antipater, the governor.

[186:3] Philosophy is an excellent thing, if only for this, that it even heals its disciples at small cost; for, in philosophy, the same thing is both dainty and healthy fare.

[186:4] I am told that you have recovered your failing appetite by pickled cabbage.

[186:5] Formerly I used to dislike it, both on account of the proverb, and because it reminded me of the poverty that went with it.

[186:6] Now, however, I am driven to change my mind.

[186:7] I laugh at the proverb when I see that cabbage is such a "good nursing mother of men," and has restored our governor to the vigour of youth.

[186:8] For the future I shall think nothing like cabbage, not even Homer's lotus, not even that ambrosia, whatever it was, which fed the Olympians.

[187:1] Letter CLXXXVII.

[187:2] Antipater to Basil.

[187:3] "Twice cabbage is death," says the unkind proverb.

[187:4] I, however, though I have called for it often, shall die once.

[187:5] Yes: even though I had never called for it at all! If you do die anyhow, don't fear to eat a delicious relish, unjustly reviled by the proverb!.

[188:1] Letter CLXXXVIII.

[188:2] (Canonica Prima.

[188:3] )  To Amphilochius, concerning the Canons.

[188:4] "Even afool," it is said, "when he asks questions," is counted wise.

[188:5] But when a wise man asks questions, he makes even a fool wise.

[188:6] And this, thank God, is my case, as often as I receive a letter from your industrious self.

[188:7] For we become more learned and wiser than we were before, merely by asking questions, because we are taught many things which we did not know; and our anxiety to answer them acts as a teacher to us.

[188:8] Assuredly at the present time, though I have never before paid attention to the points you raise, I have been forced to make accurate enquiry, and to turn over in my mind both whatever I have heard from the elders, and all that I have been taught in conformity with their lessons.

[188:9] I.

[188:10] As to your enquiry about the Cathari, a statement has already been made, and you have properly reminded me that it is right to follow the custom obtaining in each region, because those, who at the time gave decision on these points, held different opinions concerning their baptism.

[188:11] But the baptism of the Pepuzeni seems to me to have no authority; and I am astonished how this can have escaped Dionysius, acquainted as he was with the canons.

[188:12] The old authorities decided to accept that baptism which in nowise errs from the faith.

[188:13] Thus they used the names of heresies, of schisms, and of unlawful congregations.

[188:14] By heresies they meant men who were altogether broken off and alienated in matters relating to the actual faith; by schisms men who had separated for some ecclesiastical reasons and questions capable of mutual solution; by unlawful congregations gatherings held by disorderly presbyters or bishops or by uninstructed laymen.

[188:15] As, for instance, if a man be convicted of crime, and prohibited from discharging ministerial functions, and then refuses to submit to the canons, but arrogates to himself episcopal and ministerial rights, and persons leave the Catholic Church and join him, this is unlawful assembly.

[188:16] To disagree with members of the Church about repentance, is schism.

[188:17] Instances of heresy are those of the Manichaeans, of the Valentinians, of the Marcionites, and of these Pepuzenes; for with them there comes in at once their disagreement concerning the actual faith in God.

[188:18] So it seemed good to the ancient authorities to reject the baptism of heretics altogether, but to admit that of schismatics, on the ground that they still belonged to the Church.

[188:19] As to those who assembled in unlawful congregations, their decision was to join them again to the Church, after they had been brought to a better state by proper repentance and rebuke, and so, in many cases, when men in orders had rebelled with the disorderly, to receive them on their repentance, into the same rank.

[188:20] Now the Pepuzeni are plainly heretical, for, by unlawfully and shamefully applying to Montanus and Priscilla the title of the Paraclete, they have blasphemed against the Holy Ghost.

[188:21] They are, therefore, to be condemned for ascribing divinity to men; and for outraging the Holy Ghost by comparing Him to men.

[188:22] They are thus also liable to eternal damnation, inasmuch as blasphemy against the Holy Ghost admits of no forgiveness.

[188:23] What ground is there, then, for the acceptance of the baptism of men who baptize into the Father and the Son and Montanus or Priscilla? For those who have not been baptized into the names delivered to us have not been baptized at all.

[188:24] So that, although this escaped the vigilance of the great Dionysius, we must by no means imitate his error.

[188:25] The absurdity of the position is obvious in a moment, and evident to all who are gifted with even a small share of reasoning capacity.

[188:26] The Cathari are schismatics; but it seemed good to the ancient authorities, I mean Cyprian and our own Firmilianus, to reject all these, Cathari, Encratites, and Hydroparastatae, by one common condemnation, because the origin of separation arose through schism, and those who had apostatized from the Church had no longer on them the grace of the Holy Spirit, for it ceased to be imparted when the continuity was broken.

[188:27] The first separatists had received their ordination from the Fathers, and possessed the spiritual gift by the laying on of their hands.

[188:28] But they who were broken off had become laymen, and, because they are no longer able to confer on others that grace of the Holy Spirit from which they themselves are fallen away, they had no authority either to baptize or to ordain.

[188:29] And therefore those who were from time to time baptized by them, were ordered, as though baptized by laymen, to come to the church to be purified by the Church's true baptism.

[188:30] Nevertheless, since it has seemed to some of those of Asia that, for the sake of management of the majority, their baptism should be accepted, let it be accepted.

[188:31] We must, however, perceive the iniquitous action of the Encratites; who, in order to shut themselves out from being received back by the Church have endeavoured for the future to anticipate readmission by a peculiar baptism of their own, violating, in this manner even their own special practice.

[188:32] My opinion, therefore, is that nothing being distinctly laid down concerning them, it is our duty to reject their baptism, and that in the case of any one who has received baptism from them, we should, on his coming to the church, baptize him.

[188:33] If, however, there is any likelihood of this being detrimental to general discipline, we must fall back upon custom, and follow the fathers who have ordered what course we are to pursue.

[188:34] For I am under some apprehension lest, in our wish to discourage them from baptizing, we may, through the severity of our decision, be a hindrance to those who are being saved.

[188:35] If they accept our baptism, do not allow this to distress us.

[188:36] We are by no means bound to return them the same favour, but only strictly to obey canons.

[188:37] On every ground let it be enjoined that those who come to us from their baptism be anointed in the presence of the faithful, and only on these terms approach the mysteries.

[188:38] I am aware that I have received into episcopal rank Izois and Saturninus from the Encratite following.

[188:39] I am precluded therefore from separating from the Church those who have been united to their company, inasmuch as, through my acceptance of the bishops, I have promulgated a kind of canon of communion with them.

[188:40] II.

[188:41] The woman who purposely destroys her unborn child is guilty of murder.

[188:42] With us there is no nice enquiry as to its being formed or unformed.

[188:43] In this case it is not only the being about to be born who is vindicated, but the woman in her attack upon herself; because in most cases women who make such attempts die.

[188:44] The destruction of the embryo is an additional crime, a second murder, at all events if we regard it as done with intent.

[188:45] The punishment, however, of these women should not be for life, but for the term of ten years.

[188:46] And let their treatment depend not on mere lapse of time, but on the character of their repentance.

[188:47] III.

[188:48] A deacon who commits fornication after his appointment to the diaconate is to be deposed.

[188:49] But, after he has been rejected and ranked among the laity, he is not to be excluded from communion.

[188:50] For there is an ancient canon that those who have fallen from their degree are to be subjected to this kind of punishment alone.

[188:51] Herein, as I suppose, the ancient authorities followed the old rule "Thou shalt not avenge twice for the same thing".

[188:52] There is this further reason too, that laymen, when expelled from the place of the faithful, are from time to time restored to the rank whence they have fallen; but the deacon undergoes once for all the lasting penalty of deposition.

[188:53] His deacon's orders not being restored to him, they rested at this one punishment.

[188:54] So far is this as regards what depends on law laid down.

[188:55] But generally a truer remedy is the departure from sin.

[188:56] Wherefore that man will give me full proof of his cure who, after rejecting grace for the sake of the indulgence of the flesh, has then, through bruising of the flesh and the enslaving of it by means of self control, abandoned the pleasures whereby he was subdued.

[188:57] We ought therefore to know both what is of exact prescription and what is of custom; and, in cases which do not admit of the highest treatment, to follow the traditional direction.

[188:58] IV.

[188:59] In the case of trigamy and polygamy they laid down the same rule, in proportion, as in the case of digamy; namely one year for digamy (some authorities say two years); for trigamy men are separated for three and often for four years; but this is no longer described as marriage at all, but as polygamy; nay rather as limited fornication.

[188:60] It is for this reason that the Lord said to the woman of Samaria, who had five husbands, "he whom thou now hast is not thy husband".

[188:61] He does not reckon those who had exceeded the limits of a second marriage as worthy of the title of husband or wife.

[188:62] In cases of trigamy we have accepted a seclusion of five years, not by the canons, but following the precept of our predecessors.

[188:63] Such offenders ought not to be altogether prohibited from the privileges of the Church; they should be considered deserving of hearing after two or three years, and afterwards of being permitted to stand in their place; but they must be kept from the communion of the good gift, and only restored to the place of communion after showing some fruit of repentance.

[188:64] V.

[188:65] Heretics repenting at death ought to be received; yet to be received, of course, not indiscriminately, but on trial of exhibition of true repentance and of producing fruit in evidence of their zeal for salvation.

[188:66] VI.

[188:67] The fornication of canonical persons is not to be reckoned as wedlock, and their union is to be completely dissolved, for this is both profitable for the security of the Church and will prevent the heretics from having a ground of attack against us, as though we induced men to join us by the attraction of liberty to sin.

[188:68] VII.

[188:69] Abusers of themselves with mankind, and with beasts, as also murderers, wizards, adulterers, and idolaters, are deserving of the same punishment.

[188:70] Whatever rule you have in the case of the rest, observe also in their case.

[188:71] There can, however, be no doubt that we ought to receive those who have repented of impurity committed in ignorance for thirty years.

[188:72] In this case there is ground for forgiveness in ignorance, in the spontaneity of confession, and the long extent of time.

[188:73] Perhaps they have been delivered to Satan for a whole age of man that they may learn not to behave unseemly; wherefore order them to be received without delay, specially if they shed tears to move your mercy, and shew a manner of living worthy of compassion.

[188:74] VIII.

[188:75] The man who in a rage has taken up a hatchet against his own wife is a murderer.

[188:76] But it is what I should have expected from your intelligence that you should very properly remind me to speak on these points more fully, because a wide distinction must be drawn between cases where there is and where there is not intent.

[188:77] A case of an act purely unintentional, and widely removed from the purpose of the agent, is that of a man who throws a stone at a dog or a tree, and hits a man.

[188:78] The object was to drive off the beast or to shake down the fruit.

[188:79] The chance comer falls fortuitously in the way of the blow, and the act is unintentional.

[188:80] Unintentional too is the act of any one who strikes another with a strap or a flexible stick, for the purpose of chastising him, and the man who is being beaten dies.

[188:81] In this case it must be taken into consideration that the object was not to kill, but to improve, the offender.

[188:82] Further, among unintentional acts must be reckoned the case of a man in a fight who when warding off an enemy's attack with cudgel or hand, hits him without mercy in some vital part, so as to injure him, though not quite to kill him.

[188:83] This, however, comes very near to the intentional; for the man who employs such a weapon in self defence, or who strikes without mercy, evidently does not spare his opponent, because he is mastered by passion.

[188:84] In like manner the case of any one who uses a heavy cudgel, or a stone too big for a man to stand, is reckoned among the unintentional, because he does not do what he meant: in his rage he deals such a blow as to kill his victim, yet all he had in his mind was to give him a thrashing, not to do him to death.

[188:85] If, however, a man uses a sword, or anything of the kind, he has no excuse: certainly none if he throws his hatchet.

[188:86] For he does not strike with the hand, so that the force of the blow may be within his own control, but throws, so that from the weight and edge of the iron, and the force of the throw, the wound cannot fail to be fatal.

[188:87] On the other hand acts done in the attacks of war or robbery are distinctly intentional, and admit of no doubt.

[188:88] Robbers kill for greed, and to avoid conviction.

[188:89] Soldiers who inflict death in war do so with the obvious purpose not of fighting, nor chastising, but of killing their opponents.

[188:90] And if any one has concocted some magic philtre for some other reason, and then causes death, I count this as intentional.

[188:91] Women frequently endeavour to draw men to love them by incantations and magic knots, and give them drugs which dull their intelligence.

[188:92] Such women, when they cause death, though the result of their action may not be what they intended, are nevertheless, on account of their proceedings being magical and prohibited, to be reckoned among intentional homicides.

[188:93] Women also who administer drugs to cause abortion, as well as those who take poisons to destroy unborn children, are murderesses.

[188:94] So much on this subject.

[188:95] IX.

[188:96] The sentence of the Lord that it is unlawful to withdraw from wedlock, save on account of fornication, applies, according to the argument, to men and women alike.

[188:97] Custom, however, does not so obtain.

[188:98] Yet, in relation with women, very strict expressions are to be found; as, for instance, the words of the apostle "He which is joined to a harlot is one body" and of Jeremiah, If a wife "become another man's shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted?" And again, "He that hath an adulteress is a fool and impious".

[188:99] Yet custom ordains that men who commit adultery and are in fornication be retained by their wives.

[188:100] Consequently I do not know if the woman who lives with the man who has been dismissed can properly be called an adulteress; the charge in this case attaches to the woman who has put away her husband, and depends upon the cause for which she withdrew from wedlock.

[188:101] In the case of her being beaten, and refusing to submit, it would be better for her to endure than to be separated from her husband; in the case of her objecting to pecuniary loss, even here she would not have sufficient ground.

[188:102] If her reason is his living in fornication we do not find this in the custom of the church; but from an unbelieving husband a wife is commanded not to depart, but to remain, on account of the uncertainty of the issue.

[188:103] "For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?" Here then the wife, if she leaves her husband and goes to another, is an adulteress.

[188:104] But the man who has been abandoned is pardonable, and the woman who lives with such a man is not condemned.

[188:105] But if the man who has deserted his wife goes to another, he is himself an adulterer because he makes her commit adultery; and the woman who lives with him is an adulteress, because she has caused another woman's husband to come over to her.

[188:106] X.

[188:107] Those who swear that they will not receive ordination, declining orders upon oath, must not be driven to perjure themselves, although there does seem to be a canon making concessions to such persons.

[188:108] Yet I have found by experience that perjurers never turn out well.

[188:109] Account must however be taken of the form of the oath, its terms, the frame of mind in which it was taken, and the minutest additions made to the terms, since, if no ground of relief can anywhere be found, such persons must be dismissed.

[188:110] The case, however, of Severus, I mean of the presbyter ordained by him, does seem to me to allow of relief of this kind, if you will permit it.

[188:111] Give directions for the district placed under Mestia, to which the man was appointed, to be reckoned under Vasoda.

[188:112] Thus he will not forswear himself by not departing from the place, and Longinus, having Cyriacus with him, will not leave the Church unprovided for, nor himself be guilty of neglect of work.

[188:113] I moreover shall not be held guilty of taking action in contravention of any canons by making a concession to Cyriacus who had sworn that he would remain at Mindana and yet accepted the transfer.

[188:114] His return will be in accordance with his oath, and his obedience to the arrangement will not be reckoned against him as perjury, because it was not added to his oath that he would not go, even a short time, from Mindana, but would remain there for the future.

[188:115] Severus, who pleads forgetfulness, I shall pardon, only telling him that One who knows what is secret will not overlook the ravaging of His Church by a man of such a character; a man who originally appoints uncanonically, then imposes oaths in violation of the Gospel, then tells a man to perjure himself in the matter of his transfer, and last of all lies in pretended forgetfulness.

[188:116] I am no judge of hearts; I only judge by what I hear; let us leave vengeance to the Lord, and ourselves pardon the common human error of forgetfulness, and receive the man without question.

[188:117] XI.

[188:118] The man who is guilty of unintentional homicide has given sufficient satisfaction in eleven years.

[188:119] We shall, without doubt, observe what is laid down by Moses in the case of wounded men, and shall not hold a murder to have been committed in the case of a man who lies down after he has been struck, and walks again leaning on his staff.

[188:120] If, however, he does not rise again after he has been struck, nevertheless, from there being no intent to kill, the striker is a homicide, but an unintentional homicide.

[188:121] XII.

[188:122] The canon absolutely excludes digamists from the ministry.

[188:123] XIII.

[188:124] Homicide in war is not reckoned by our Fathers as homicide; I presume from their wish to make concession to men fighting on behalf of chastity and true religion.

[188:125] Perhaps, however, it is well to counsel that those whose hands are not clean only abstain from communion for three years.

[188:126] XIV.

[188:127] A taker of usury, if he consent to spend his unjust gain on the poor, and to be rid for the future of the plague of covetousness, may be received into the ministry.

[188:128] XV.

[188:129] I am astonished at your requiring exactitude in Scripture, and arguing that there is something forced in the diction of the interpretation which gives the meaning of the original, but does not exactly render what is meant by the Hebrew word.

[188:130] Yet I must not carelessly pass by the question started by an enquiring mind.

[188:131] At the creation of the world, birds of the air and the fishes of the sea had the same origin; for both kinds were produced from the water.

[188:132] The reason is that both have the same characteristics.

[188:133] The latter swim in the water, the former in the air.

[188:134] They are therefore mentioned together.

[188:135] The form of expression is not used without distinction, but of all that lives in the water it is used very properly.

[188:136] The birds of the air and the fishes of the sea are subject to man; and not they alone, but all that passes through the paths of the sea.

[188:137] For every water-creature is not a fish, as for instance the sea monsters, whales, sharks, dolphins, seals, even sea-horses, sea-dogs, saw-fish, sword-fish, and sea-cows; and, if you like, sea nettles, cockles and all hard-shelled creatures of whom none are fish, and all pass through the paths of the sea; so that there are three kinds, birds of the air, fishes of the sea, and all water-creatures which are distinct from fish, and pass through the paths of the sea.

[188:138] XVI.

[188:139] Naaman was not a great man with the Lord, but with his lord; that is, he was one of the chief princes of the King of the Syrians.

[188:140] Read your Bible carefully, and you will find the answer to your question there.

[189:1] Letter CLXXXIX.

[189:2] To Eustathius the physician.

[189:3] Humanity is the regular business of all you who practise as physicians.

[189:4] And, in my opinion, to put your science at the head and front of life's pursuits is to decide reasonably and rightly.

[189:5] This at all events seems to be the case if man's most precious possession, life, is painful and not worth living, unless it be lived in health, and if for health we are dependent on your skill.

[189:6] In your own case medicine is seen, as it were, with two right hands; you enlarge the accepted limits of philanthropy by not confining the application of your skill to men's bodies, but by attending also to the cure of the diseases of their souls.

[189:7] It is not only in accordance with popular report that I thus write.

[189:8] I am moved by the personal experience which I have had on many occasions and to a remarkable degree at the present time, in the midst of the unspeakable wickedness of our enemies, which has flooded our life like a noxious torrent.

[189:9] You have most skilfully dispersed it and by pouring in your soothing words have allayed the inflammation of my heart.

[189:10] Having regard to the successive and diversified attacks of my enemies against me, I thought that I ought to keep silence and to bear their successive assaults without reply, and without attempting to contradict foes armed with a lie, that terrible weapon which too often drives its point through the heart of truth herself.

[189:11] You did well in urging me not to abandon the defence of truth, but rather to convict our calumniators, lest haply, by the success of lies, many be hurt.

[189:12] 2.

[189:13] In adopting an unexpected attitude of hatred against me my opponents seem to be repeating the old story in aesop.

[189:14] He makes the wolf bring certain charges against the lamb, as being really ashamed to seem to kill a creature who had done him no harm without some reasonable pretext; then when the lamb easily rebuts the slander, the wolf, none the less, continues his attack, and, though defeated in equity, comes off winner in biting.

[189:15] Just so with those who seem to count hatred to me as a virtue.

[189:16] They will perhaps blush to hate me without a cause, and so invent pleas and charges against me, without abiding by any of their allegations, but urging as the ground of their detestation now this, now that, and now something else.

[189:17] In no single case is their malice consistent; but when they are baulked in one charge they cling to another and, foiled in this, have recourse to a third; and if all their accusations are scattered they do not drop their ill-will.

[189:18] They say that I preach three Gods, dinning the charge into the ears of the mob and pressing the calumny plausibly and persistently Nevertheless, truth is fighting on my side; and both in public to all the world, and in private to all whom I meet, I prove that I anathematize every one who maintains three Gods and do not even allow him to be a Christian.

[189:19] No sooner do they hear this than Sabellius is handy for them to urge against me, and it is noised abroad that my teaching is tainted with his error.

[189:20] Once more I hold out in my defence my wonted weapon of truth, and demonstrate that I shudder at Sabellianism as much as at Judaism.

[189:21] 3.

[189:22] What then? After all these efforts were they tired? Did they leave off? Not at all.

[189:23] They are charging me with innovation, and base their charge on my confession of three hypostases, and blame me for asserting one Goodness, one Power, one Godhead.

[189:24] In this they are not wide of the truth, for I do so assert.

[189:25] Their complaint is that their custom does not accept this, and that Scripture does not agree.

[189:26] What is my reply? I do not consider it fair that the custom which obtains among them should be regarded as a law and rule of orthodoxy.

[189:27] If custom is to be taken in proof of what is right, then it is certainly competent for me to put forward on my side the custom which obtains here.

[189:28] If they reject this, we are clearly not bound to follow them.

[189:29] Therefore let God-inspired Scripture decide between us; and on whichever side be found doctrines in harmony with the word of God, in favour of that side will be cast the vote of truth.

[189:30] What then is the charge? Two points are advanced at one and the same time in the accusations levelled against me.

[189:31] I am accused on the one hand of parting the hypostases asunder; on the other of never using in the plural any one of the nouns relating to the Divinity, but of always speaking in the singular number of one Goodness, as I have already said; of one Power; one Godhead; and so on.

[189:32] As to the parting of the hypostases, there ought to be no objection nor opposition on the part of those who assert in the case of the divine nature a distinction of essences.

[189:33] For it is unreasonable to maintain three essences and to object to three hypostases.

[189:34] Nothing, then, is left but the charge of using words of the divine nature in the singulars.

[189:35] 4.

[189:36] I have quite a little difficulty in meeting the second charge.

[189:37] Whoever condemns those who assert that the Godhead is one, must of necessity agree with all who maintain many godheads, or with those who maintain that there is none.

[189:38] No third position is conceivable.

[189:39] The teaching of inspired Scripture does not allow of our speaking of many godheads, but, wherever it mentions the Godhead, speaks of it in the singular number; as, for instance, "in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".

[189:40] And again; "for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead".

[189:41] If, then, to multiply godheads is the special mark of the victims of polytheistic error, and to deny the Godhead altogether is to fall into atheism, what sense is there in this charge against me of confessing one Godhead? But they make a plainer disclosure of the end they have in view; namely, in the case of the Father to agree that He is God, and consenting in like manner that the Son be honoured with the attribute of Godhead; but to refuse to comprehend the Spirit, though reckoned with Father and with Son in the idea of Godhead.

[189:42] They allow that the power of the Godhead extends from the Father to the Son, but they divide the nature of the Spirit from the divine glory.

[189:43] Against this view, to the best of my ability, I must enter a brief defence of my own position.

[189:44] 5.

[189:45] What, then, is my argument? In delivering the Faith of Salvation to those who are being made disciples in His doctrine, the Lord conjoins with Father and with Son the Holy Spirit also.

[189:46] That which is conjoined once I maintain to be conjoined everywhere and always.

[189:47] There is no question here of a ranking together in one respect and isolation in others.

[189:48] In the quickening power whereby our nature is transformed from the life of corruption to immortality, the power of the Spirit is comprehended with Father and with Son, and in many other instances, as in the conception of the good, the holy, the eternal, the wise, the right, the supreme, the efficient, and generally in all terms which have the higher meaning, He is inseparably united.

[189:49] Wherefrom I judge it right to hold that the Spirit, thus conjoined with Father and Son in so many sublime and divine senses, is never separated.

[189:50] Indeed I am unaware of any degrees of better or worse in the terms concerning the divine nature, nor can I imagine its being reverent and right to allow the Spirit a participation in those of lesser dignity, while He is judged unworthy of the higher.

[189:51] For all conceptions and terms which regard the divine are of equal dignity one with another, in that they do not vary in regard to the meaning of the subject matter to which they are applied.

[189:52] Our thought is not led to one subject by the attribution of good, and to another by that of wise, powerful, and just; mention any attributes you will, the thing signified is one and the same.

[189:53] And if you name God, you mean the same Being whom you understood by the rest of the terms.

[189:54] Granting, then, that all the terms applied to the divine nature are of equal force one with another in relation to that which they describe, one emphasizing one point and another another, but all bringing our intelligence to the contemplation of the same object; what ground is there for conceding to the Spirit fellowship with Father and Son in all other terms, and isolating Him from the Godhead alone? There is no escape from the position that we must either allow the fellowship here, or refuse it everywhere.

[189:55] & If He is worthy in every other respect, He is certainly not unworthy in this.

[189:56] If, as our opponents argue, He is too insignificant to be allowed fellowship with Father and with Son in Godhead, He is not worthy to share any single one of the divine attributes: for when the terms are carefully considered, and compared with one another, by the help of the special meaning contemplated in each, they will be found to involve nothing less than the title of God.

[189:57] A proof of what I say lies in the fact that even many inferior objects are designated by this name.

[189:58] Nay, Holy Scripture does not even shrink from using this term in the case of things of a totally opposite character, as when it applies the title god to idols.

[189:59] "Let the gods," it is written, "who have not made heaven and earth, be taken away, and cast beneath the earth;" and again, "the gods of the nations are idols".

[189:60] And the witch, when she called up the required spirits for Saul, is said to have seen gods.

[189:61] Balaam too, an augur and seer, with the oracles in his hand, as Scripture says, when he had got him the teaching of the demons by his divine ingenuity, is described by Scripture as taking counsel with God.

[189:62] From many similar instances in Holy Scripture it may be proved that the name of God has no pre-eminence over other words which are applied to the divine, since, as has been said, we find it employed without distinction even in the case of things of quite opposite character.

[189:63] On the other hand we are taught by Scripture that the names holy, incorruptible, righteous, and good, are nowhere indiscriminately used of unworthy objects.

[189:64] It follows, then, that if they do not deny that the Holy Spirit is associated with the Son and with the Father, in the names which are specially applied, by the usage of true religion, to the divine nature alone, there is no reasonable ground for refusing to allow the same association in the case of that word alone which, as I have shown, is used as a recognised homonym even of demons and idols.

[189:65] 6.

[189:66] But they contend that this title sets forth the nature of that to which it is applied; that the nature of the Spirit is not a nature shared in common with that of Father and of Son; and that, for this reason, the Spirit ought not to be allowed the common use of the name.

[189:67] It is, therefore, for them to show by what means they have perceived this variation in the nature.

[189:68] If it were indeed possible for the divine nature to be contemplated in itself; could what is proper to it and what is foreign to it be discovered by means of visible things; we should then certainly stand in no need of words or other tokens to lead us to the apprehension of the object of the enquiry.

[189:69] But the divine nature is too exalted to be perceived as objects of enquiry are perceived, and about things which are beyond our knowledge we reason on probable evidence.

[189:70] We are therefore of necessity guided in the investigation of the divine nature by its operations.

[189:71] Suppose we observe the operations of the Father, of the Son, of the Holy Ghost, to be different from one another, we shall then conjecture, from the diversity of the operations that the operating natures are also different.

[189:72] For it is impossible that things which are distinct, as regards their nature, should be associated as regards the form of their operations; fire does not freeze; ice does not warm; difference of natures implies difference of the operations proceeding from them.

[189:73] Grant, then, that we perceive the operation of Father, Son and Holy Ghost to be one and the same, in no respect showing difference or variation; from this identity of operation we necessarily infer the unity of the nature.

[189:74] 7.

[189:75] The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost alike hallow, quicken, enlighten, and comfort.

[189:76] No one will attribute a special and peculiar operation of hallowing to the operation of the Spirit, after hearing the Saviour in the Gospel saying to the Father about His disciples, sanctify them in Thy name.

[189:77] In like manner all other operations are equally performed, in all who are worthy of them, by the Father and by the Son and by the Holy Ghost; every grace and virtue, guidance, life, consolation, change into the immortal, the passage into freedom and all other good things which come down to man.

[189:78] Nay even the dispensation which is above us in relation to the creature considered both in regard to intelligence and sense, if indeed it is possible for any conjecture concerning what lies above us to be formed from what we know, is not constituted apart from the operation and power of the Holy Ghost, every individual sharing His help in proportion to the dignity and need of each.

[189:79] Truly the ordering and administration of beings above our nature is obscure to our perception; nevertheless any one, arguing from what is known to us, would find it more reasonable to conclude that the power of the Spirit operates even in those beings, than that He is excluded from the government of supramundane things.

[189:80] So to assert is to advance a blasphemy bare and unsupported; it is to support absurdity on fallacy.

[189:81] On the other hand to agree that even the world beyond us is governed by the power of the Spirit, as well as by that of the Father and of the Son, is to advance a contention, supported on the plain testimony of what is seen in human life.

[189:82] Identity of operation in the case of Father and of Son and of Holy Ghost clearly proves invariability of nature.

[189:83] It follows that, even if the name of Godhead does signify nature, the community of essence proves that this title is very properly applied to the Holy Spirit.

[189:84] 8.

[189:85] I am, however, at a loss to understand how our opponents with all their ingenuity can adduce the title of Godhead in proof of nature, as though they had never heard from Scripture that nature does not result from institution and appointment.

[189:86] Moses was made a god of the Egyptians when the divine voice said, "See I have made thee a god to Pharaoh.

[189:87] The title therefore does give proof of a certain authority of oversight or of action.

[189:88] The divine nature, on the other hand, in all the words which are contrived, remains always inexplicable, as I always teach.

[189:89] We have learnt that it is beneficent, judicial, righteous, good, and so on; and so have been taught differences of operations.

[189:90] But we are, nevertheless, unable to understand the nature of the operator through our idea of the operations.

[189:91] Let any one give an account of each one of these names, and of the actual nature to which they are applied, and it will be found that the definition will not in both cases be the same.

[189:92] And where the definition is not identical the nature is different.

[189:93] There is, then, a distinction to be observed between the essence, of which no explanatory term has yet been discovered, and the meaning of the names applied to it in reference to some operation or dignity.

[189:94] That there should be no difference in the operations we infer from the community of terms.

[189:95] But, we derive no clear proof of variation in nature, because, as has been said, identity of operations indicates community of nature.

[189:96] If then Godhead be the name of an operation, we say that the Godhead is one, as there is one operation of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; if, however, as is popularly supposed, the name of Godhead indicates nature, then, since we find no variation in the nature, we reasonably define the Holy Trinity to be of one Godhead.

[190:1] Letter CXC.

[190:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[190:3] 1.

[190:4] The interest which you have shewn in the affairs of the Isaurian Church is only what might have been expected from that zeal and propriety of conduct which so continually rouses my admiration of you.

[190:5] The most careless observer must at once perceive that it is in all respects more advantageous for care and anxiety to be divided among several bishops.

[190:6] This has not escaped your observation, and you have done well in noting, and in acquainting me with, the position of affairs.

[190:7] But it is not easy to find fit men.

[190:8] While, then, we are desirous of having the credit that comes of numbers, and cause God's Church to be more effectively administered by more officers, let us be careful lest we unwittingly bring the word into contempt on account of the unsatisfactory character of the men who are called to office, and accustom the laity to indifference.

[190:9] You yourself know well that the conduct of the governed is commonly of a piece with that of those who are set over them.

[190:10] Perhaps therefore it might be better to appoint one well approved man, though even this may not be an easy matter, to the supervision of the whole city, and entrust him with the management of details on his own responsibility.

[190:11] Only let him be a servant of God, "a workman that needeth not to be ashamed," not "looking on his own things," but on the things of the most, "that they be saved".

[190:12] If he finds himself overweighted with responsibility, he will associate other labourers for the harvest with himself.

[190:13] If only we can find such a man, I own that I think the one worth many, and the ordering of the cure of souls in this way likely to be attended at once with more advantage to the Churches and with less risk to us.

[190:14] If, however, this course prove difficult, let us first do our best to appoint superintendents to the small townships or villages which have of old been episcopal sees.

[190:15] Then afterwards we will appoint once more the [bishop] of the city.

[190:16] Unless we take this course the man appointed may prove a hindrance to subsequent administration, and from his wish to rule over a larger diocese, and his refusal to accept the ordination of the bishops, we may find ourselves suddenly involved in a domestic quarrel.

[190:17] If this course is difficult, and time does not allow, see to it that the Isaurian bishop is strictly kept within his own bounds by ordaining some of his immediate neighbours.

[190:18] In the future it will be reserved for us to give to the rest bishops at the proper season, after we have carefully examined those whom we ourselves may judge to be most fit.

[190:19] 2.

[190:20] I have asked George, as you requested.

[190:21] He replies as you reported.

[190:22] In all this we must remain quiet, casting the care of the house on the Lord.

[190:23] For I put my trust in the Holy God that He will by my aid grant to him deliverance from his difficulties in some other way, and to me to live my life without trouble.

[190:24] If this cannot be, be so good as to send me word yourself as to what part I must look after, that I may begin to ask this favour of each of my friends in power, either for nothing, or for some moderate price, as the Lord may prosper me.

[190:25] I have, in accordance with your request, written to brother Valerius.

[190:26] Matters at Nyssa are going on as they were left by your reverence, and, by the aid of your holiness, are improving.

[190:27] Of those who were then separated from me some have gone off to the court, and some remain waiting for tidings from it.

[190:28] The Lord is able as well to frustrate the expectations of these latter as to make the return of the former useless.

[190:29] 3.

[190:30] Philo, on the authority of some Jewish tradition, explains the manna to have been of such a nature that it changed with the taste of the eater: that of itself it was like millet seed boiled in honey; it served sometimes for bread, sometimes for meat, either of birds or beasts; at other times for vegetables, according to each man's liking; even for fish so that the flavour of each separate kind was exactly reproduced in the eater's mouth.

[190:31] Scripture recognises chariots containing three riders, because while other chariots contained two, the driver and the man-at-arms, Pharaoh's held three, two men-at-arms, and one to hold the reins.

[190:32] Sympius has written me a letter expressive of respect and communion.

[190:33] The letter which I have written in reply I am sending to your holiness, that you may send it on to him if you quite approve of it, with the addition of some communication from yourself.

[190:34] May you, by the loving kindness of the Holy One, be preserved for me and for the Church of God, in good health, happy in the Lord, and ever praying for me.

[191:1] Letter CXCI.

[191:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[191:3] On reading the letter of your reverence I heartily thanked God.

[191:4] I did so because I found in your expressions traces of ancient affection.

[191:5] You are not like the majority.

[191:6] You did not persist in refusing to begin an affectionate correspondence.

[191:7] You have learned the greatness of the prize promised to the saints for humility, and so you have chosen, by taking the second place, to get before me.

[191:8] Among Christians such are the conditions of victory, and it is he who is content to take the second place who wins a crown.

[191:9] But I must not be behindhand in this virtuous rivalry, and so I thus salute your reverence in return; and inform you as to how I am minded, in that, since agreement in the faith is established among us, there is nothing further to prevent our being one body and one spirit, as we have been called in one hope of our calling.

[191:10] It is for you, then, of your charity to follow up a good beginning to rally men of like mind to stand at your side, and to appoint both time and place for meeting.

[191:11] Thus, by God's grace, through mutual accommodation we may govern the Churches by the ancient kind of love; receiving as our own members brothers coming from the other side, sending as to our kin, and in turn receiving as from our own kin.

[191:12] Such, indeed, was once the boast of the Church.

[191:13] Brothers from each Church, travelling from one end of the world to the other, were provided with little tokens, and found all men fathers and brothers.

[191:14] This is a privilege whereof, like all the rest, the enemy of Christ's Churches has robbed us.

[191:15] We are confined each in his own city, and every one looks at his neighbour with distrust.

[191:16] What more is to be said but that our love has grown cold, whereby alone our Lord has told us that His disciples are distinguished? First of all, if you will, do you become known to one another, that I may know with whom I am to be in agreement.

[191:17] Thus by common consent we will fix on some place convenient to both, and, at a season suitable for travelling, we will hasten to meet one another; the Lord will direct us in the way.

[191:18] Farewell.

[191:19] Be of good cheer.

[191:20] Pray for me.

[191:21] May you be granted to me by the grace of the Holy One?.

[192:1] Letter CXCII.

[192:2] To Sophronius the Master.

[192:3] With your extraordinary zeal in good deeds you have written to me to say that you yourself owe me double thanks; first, for getting a letter from me, and secondly, for doing me a service.

[192:4] What thanks, then, must not I owe you, both for reading your most delightful words, and for finding what I hoped for so quickly accomplished! The message was exceedingly gratifying on its own account, but it gave me much greater gratification from the fact that you were the friend to whom I owed the boon.

[192:5] God grant that ere long I may see you, and return you thanks in words, and enjoy the great pleasure of your society.

[193:1] Letter CXCIII.

[193:2] To Meletius the Physician.

[193:3] I am not able to flee from the discomforts of winter so well as cranes are, although for foreseeing the future I am quite as clever as a crane.

[193:4] But as to liberty of life the birds are almost as far ahead of me as they are in the being able to fly.

[193:5] In the first place I have been detained by certain worldly business; then I have been so wasted by constant and violent attacks of fever that there does seem something thinner even than I was,—I am thinner than ever.

[193:6] Besides all this, bouts of quartan ague have gone on for more than twenty turns.

[193:7] Now I do seem to be free from fever, but I am in such a feeble state that I am no stronger than a cobweb.

[193:8] Hence the shortest journey is too far for me, and every breath of wind is more dangerous to me than big waves to those at sea.

[193:9] I have no alternative but to hide in my hut and wait for spring, if only I can last out so long, and am not carried off beforehand by the internal malady of which I am never rid.

[193:10] If the Lord saves me with His mighty hand, I shall gladly betake myself to your remote region, and gladly embrace a friend so dear.

[193:11] Only pray that my life may be ordered as may be best for my soul's good.

[194:1] Letter CXCIV.

[194:2] To Zoilus.

[194:3] What are you about, most excellent sir, in anticipating me in humility? Educated as you are, and able to write such a letter as you have sent, you nevertheless ask for forgiveness at my hands, as though you were engaged in some undertaking rash and beyond your position.

[194:4] But a truce to mockery.

[194:5] Continue to write to me on every occasion.

[194:6] Am I not wholly illiterate? It is delightful to read the letters of an eloquent writer.

[194:7] Have I learned from Scripture how good a thing is love? I count intercourse with a loving friend invaluable.

[194:8] And I do hope that you may tell me of all the good gifts which I pray for you; the best of health, and the prosperity of all your house.

[194:9] Now as to my own affairs, my condition is not more endurable than usual.

[194:10] It is enough to tell you this and you will understand the bad state of my health.

[194:11] It has indeed reached such extreme suffering as to be as difficult to describe as to experience, if indeed your own experience has fallen short of mine.

[194:12] But it is the work of the good God to give me power to bear in patience whatever trials are inflicted on me for my own good at the hands of our merciful Lord.

[195:1] Letter CXCV.

[195:2] To Euphronius, bishop of Colonia Armeniae.

[195:3] Colonia, which the Lord has placed under your authority, is far out of the way of ordinary routes.

[195:4] The consequence is that, although I am frequently writing to the rest of the brethren in Armenia Minor, I hesitate to write to your reverence, because I have no expectation of finding any one to convey my letter.

[195:5] Now, however, that I am hoping either for your presence, or that my letter will be sent on to you by some of the bishops to whom I have written, I thus write and salute you by letter.

[195:6] I wish to tell you that I seem to be still alive, and at the same time to exhort you to pray for me, that the Lord may lessen my afflictions, and lift from me the heavy load of pain which now presses like a cloud upon my heart.

[195:7] I shall have this relief if He will only grant a quick restoration to those godly bishops who are now punished for their faithfulness to true religion by being scattered all abroad.

[196:1] Letter CXCVI.

[196:2] To Aburgius.

[196:3] Rumour, messenger of good news, is continually reporting how you dart across, like the stars, appearing now here, now there, in the barbarian regions; now supplying the troops with provisions, now appearing in gorgeous array before the emperor.

[196:4] I pray God that your doings may prosper as they deserve, and that you may achieve eminent success.

[196:5] I pray that, so long as I live and breathe this air, (for my life now is no more than drawing breath), our country may from time to time behold you.

[197:1] Letter CXCVII.

[197:2] To Ambrose, bishop of Milan.

[197:3] 1.

[197:4] The gifts of the Lord are ever great and many; in greatness beyond measure, in number incalculable.

[197:5] To those who are not insensible of His mercy one of the greatest of these gifts is that of which I am now availing myself, the opportunity allowed us, far apart in place though we be, of addressing one another by letter.

[197:6] He grants us two means of becoming acquainted; one by personal intercourse, another by epistolary correspondence.

[197:7] Now I have become acquainted with you through what you have said.

[197:8] I do not mean that my memory is impressed with your outward appearance, but that the beauty of the inner man has been brought home to me by the rich variety of your utterances, for each of us "speaketh out of the abundance of the heart".

[197:9] I have given glory to God, Who in every generation selects those who are well-pleasing to Him; Who of old indeed chose from the sheepfold a prince for His people; Who through the Spirit gifted Amos the herdman with power and raised him up to be a prophet; Who now has drawn forth for the care of Christ's flock a man from the imperial city, entrusted with the government of a whole nation, exalted in character, in lineage, in position, in eloquence, in all that this world admires.

[197:10] This same man has flung away all the advantages of the world, counting them all loss that he may gain Christ, and has taken in his hand the helm of the ship, great and famous for its faith in God, the Church of Christ.

[197:11] Come, then, O man of God; not from men have you received or been taught the Gospel of Christ; it is the Lord Himself who has transferred you from the judges of the earth to the throne of the Apostles; fight the good fight; heal the infirmity of the people, if any are infected by the disease of Arian madness; renew the ancient footprints of the Fathers.

[197:12] You have laid the foundation of affection towards me; strive to build upon it by the frequency of your salutations.

[197:13] Thus shall we be able to be near one another in spirit, although our earthly homes are far apart.

[197:14] 2.

[197:15] By your earnestness and zeal in the matter of the blessed bishop Dionysius you testify all your love to the Lord, your honour for your predecessors, and your zeal for the faith.

[197:16] For our disposition towards our faithful fellow-servants is referred to the Lord Whom they have served.

[197:17] Whoever honours men that have contended for the faith proves that he has like zeal for it.

[197:18] One single action is proof of much virtue.

[197:19] I wish to acquaint your love in Christ that the very zealous brethren who have been commissioned by your reverence to act for you in this good work have won praise for all the clergy by the amiability of their manners; for by their individual modesty and conciliatoriness they have shewn the sound condition of all.

[197:20] Moreover, with all zeal and diligence they have braved an inclement season; and with unbroken perseverance have persuaded the faithful guardians of the blessed body to transmit to them the custody of what they have regarded as the safeguard of their lives.

[197:21] And you must understand that they are men who would never have been forced by any human authority or sovereignty, had not the perseverance of these brethren moved them to compliance.

[197:22] No doubt a great aid to the attainment of the object desired was the presence of our well beloved and reverend son Therasius the presbyter.

[197:23] He voluntarily undertook all the toil of the journey; he moderated the energy of the faithful on the spot; he persuaded opponents by his arguments; in the presence of priests and deacons, and of many others who fear the Lord, he took up the relics with all becoming reverence, and has aided the brethren in their preservation.

[197:24] These relics do you receive with a joy equivalent to the distress with which their custodians have parted with them and sent them to you.

[197:25] Let none dispute; let none doubt.

[197:26] Here you have that unconquered athlete.

[197:27] These bones, which shared in the conflict with the blessed soul, are known to the Lord.

[197:28] These bones He will crown, together with that soul, in the righteous day of His requital, as it is written, "we must stand before the judgment seat of Christ, that each may give an account of the deeds he has done in the body".

[197:29] One coffin held that honoured corpse.

[197:30] None other lay by his side.

[197:31] The burial was a noble one; the honours of a martyr were paid him.

[197:32] Christians who had welcomed him as a guest and then with their own hands laid him in the grave, have now disinterred him.

[197:33] They have wept as men bereaved of a father and a champion.

[197:34] But they have sent him to you, for they put your joy before their own consolation.

[197:35] Pious were the hands that gave; scrupulously careful were the hands that received.

[197:36] There has been no room for deceit; no room for guile.

[197:37] I bear witness to this.

[197:38] Let the untainted truth be accepted by you.

[198:1] Letter CXCVIII.

[198:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[198:3] After the letter conveyed to me by the officiales I have received one other despatched to me later.

[198:4] I have not sent many myself, for I have not found any one travelling in your direction.

[198:5] But I have sent more than the four, among which also were those conveyed to me from Samosata after the first epistle of your holiness.

[198:6] These I have sealed and sent to our honourable brother Leontius, peraequator of Nicaea, urging that by his agency they may be delivered to the steward of the household of our honourable brother Sophronius, that he may see to their transmission to you.

[198:7] As my letters are going through many hands, it is likely enough that because one man is very busy or very careless, your reverence may never get them.

[198:8] Pardon me, then, I beseech you, if my letters are few.

[198:9] With your usual intelligence you have properly found fault with me for not sending, as I ought, a courier of my own when there was occasion for doing so; but you must understand that we have had a winter of such severity that all the roads were blocked till Easter, and I had no one disposed to brave the difficulties of the journey.

[198:10] For although our clergy do seem very numerous, they are men inexperienced in travelling because they never traffic, and prefer not to live far away from home, the majority of them plying sedentary crafts, whereby they get their daily bread.

[198:11] The brother whom I have now sent to your reverence I have summoned from the country, and employed in the conveyance of my letter to your holiness, that he may both give you clear intelligence as to me and my affairs, and, moreover, by God's grace, bring me back plain and prompt information about you and yours.

[198:12] Our dear brother Eusebius the reader has for some time been anxious to hasten to your holiness, but I have kept him here for the weather to improve.

[198:13] Even now I am under no little anxiety lest his inexperience in travelling may cause him trouble, and bring on some illness; for he is not robust.

[198:14] 2.

[198:15] I need say nothing to you by letter about the innovations of the East, for the brothers can themselves give you accurate information.

[198:16] You must know, my honoured friend, that, when I was writing these words, I was so ill that I had lost all hope of life.

[198:17] It is impossible for me to enumerate all my painful symptoms, my weakness, the violence of my attacks of fever, and my bad health in general.

[198:18] One point only may be selected.

[198:19] I have now completed the time of my sojourn in this miserable and painful life.

[199:1] Letter CXCIX.

[199:2] Canonica Secunda.

[199:3] To Amphilochius, concerning the Canons.

[199:4] I wrote some time ago in reply to the questions of your reverence, but I did not send the letter, partly because from my long and dangerous illness I had not time to do so; partly because I had no one to send with it.

[199:5] I have but few men with me who are experienced in travelling and fit for service of this kind.

[199:6] When you thus learn the causes of my delay, forgive me.

[199:7] I have been quite astonished at your readiness to learn and at your humility.

[199:8] You are entrusted with the office of a teacher, and yet you condescend to learn, and to learn of me, who pretend to no great knowledge.

[199:9] Nevertheless, since you consent, on account of your fear of God, to do what another man might hesitate to do, I am bound for my part to go even beyond my strength in aiding your readiness and righteous zeal.

[199:10] XVII.

[199:11] You asked me about the presbyter Bianor—can he be admitted among the clergy, because of his oath? I know that I have already given the clergy of Antioch a general sentence in the case of all those who had sworn with him; namely, that they should abstain from the public congregations, but might perform priestly functions in private.

[199:12] Moreover, he has the further liberty for the performance of his ministerial functions, from the fact that his sacred duties lie not at Antioch, but at Iconium; for, as you have written to me yourself, he has chosen to live rather at the latter than at the former place.

[199:13] The man in question may, therefore, be received; but your reverence must require him to shew repentance for the rash readiness of the oath which he took before the unbeliever, being unable to bear the trouble of that small peril.

[199:14] XVIII.

[199:15] Concerning fallen virgins, who, after professing a chaste life before the Lord, make their vows vain, because they have fallen under the lusts of the flesh, our fathers, tenderly and meekly making allowance for the infirmities of them that fall, laid down that they might be received after a year, ranking them with the digamists.

[199:16] Since, however, by God's grace the Church grows mightier as she advances, and the order of virgins is becoming more numerous, it is my judgment that careful heed should be given both to the act as it appears upon consideration, and to the mind of Scripture, which may be discovered from the context.

[199:17] Widowhood is inferior to virginity; consequently the sin of the widows comes far behind that of the virgins.

[199:18] Let us see what Paul writes to Timothy.

[199:19] "The young widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; having damnation because they have cast off their first faith".

[199:20] If, therefore, a widow lies under a very heavy charge, as setting at naught her faith in Christ, what must we think of the virgin, who is the bride of Christ, and a chosen vessel dedicated to the Lord? It is a grave fault even on the part of a slave to give herself away in secret wedlock and fill the house with impurity, and, by her wicked life, to wrong her owner; but it is forsooth far more shocking for the bride to become an adulteress, and, dishonouring her union with the bridegroom, to yield herself to unchaste indulgence.

[199:21] The widow, as being a corrupted slave, is indeed condemned; but the virgin comes under the charge of adultery.

[199:22] We call the man who lives with another man's wife an adulterer, and do not receive him into communion until he has ceased from his sin; and so we shall ordain in the case of him who has the virgin.

[199:23] One point, however, must be determined beforehand, that the name virgin is given to a woman who voluntarily devotes herself to the Lord, renounces marriage, and embraces a life of holiness.

[199:24] And we admit professions dating from the age of full intelligence.

[199:25] For it is not right in such cases to admit the words of mere children.

[199:26] But a girl of sixteen or seventeen years of age, in full possession of her faculties, who has been submitted to strict examination, and is then constant, and persists in her entreaty to be admitted, may then be ranked among the virgins, her profession ratified, and its violation rigorously punished.

[199:27] Many girls are brought forward by their parents and brothers, and other kinsfolk, before they are of full age, and have no inner impulse towards a celibate life.

[199:28] The object of the friends is simply to provide for themselves.

[199:29] Such women as these must not be readily received, before we have made public investigation of their own sentiments.

[199:30] XIX.

[199:31] I do not recognise the profession of men, except in the case of those who have enrolled themselves in the order of monks, and seem to have secretly adopted the celibate life.

[199:32] Yet in their case I think it becoming that there should be a previous examination, and that a distinct profession should be received from them, so that whenever they may revert to the life of the pleasures of the flesh, they may be subjected to the punishment of fornicators.

[199:33] XX.

[199:34] I do not think that any condemnation ought to be passed on women who professed virginity while in heresy, and then afterwards preferred marriage.

[199:35] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law".

[199:36] Those who have not yet put on Christ's yoke do not recognise the laws of the Lord.

[199:37] They are therefore to be received in the church, as having remission in the case of these sins too, as of all, from their faith in Christ.

[199:38] As a general rule, all sins formerly committed in the catechumenical state are not taken into account.

[199:39] The Church does not receive these persons without baptism; and it is very necessary that in such cases the birthrights should be observed.

[199:40] XXI.

[199:41] If a man living with a wife is not satisfied with his marriage and falls into fornication, I account him a fornicator, and prolong his period of punishment.

[199:42] Nevertheless, we have no canon subjecting him to the charge of adultery, if the sin be committed against an unmarried woman.

[199:43] For the adulteress, it is said, "being polluted shall be polluted," and she shall not return to her husband: and "He that keepeth an adulteress is a fool and impious".

[199:44] He, however, who has committed fornication is not to be cut off from the society of his own wife.

[199:45] So the wife will receive the husband on his return from fornication, but the husband will expel the polluted woman from his house.

[199:46] The argument here is not easy, but the custom has so obtained.

[199:47] XXII.

[199:48] Men who keep women carried off by violence, if they carried them off when betrothed to other men, must not be received before removal of the women and their restoration to those to whom they were first contracted, whether they wish to receive them, or to separate from them.

[199:49] In the case of a girl who has been taken when not betrothed, she ought first to be removed, and restored to her own people, and handed over to the will of her own people whether parents, or brothers, or any one having authority over her.

[199:50] If they choose to give her up, the cohabitation may stand; but, if they refuse, no violence should be used.

[199:51] In the case of a man having a wife by seduction, be it secret or by violence, he must be held guilty of fornication.

[199:52] The punishment of fornicators is fixed at four years.

[199:53] In the first year they must be expelled from prayer, and weep at the door of the church; in the second they may be received to sermon; in the third to penance; in the fourth to standing with the people, while they are withheld from the oblation.

[199:54] Finally, they may be admitted to the communion of the good gift.

[199:55] XXIII.

[199:56] Concerning men who marry two sisters, or women who marry two brothers a short letter of mine has been published, of which I have sent a copy to your reverence.

[199:57] The man who has taken his own brother's wife is not to be received until he have separated from her.

[199:58] XXIV.

[199:59] A widow whose name is in the list of widows, that is, who is supported by the Church, is ordered by the Apostle to be supported no longer when she marries.

[199:60] There is no special rule for a widower.

[199:61] The punishment appointed for digamy may suffice.

[199:62] If a widow who is sixty years of age chooses again to live with a husband, she shall be held unworthy of the communion of the good gift until she be moved no longer by her impure desire.

[199:63] If we reckon her before sixty years, the blame rests with us, and not with the woman.

[199:64] XXV.

[199:65] The man who retains as his wife the woman whom he has violated, shall be liable to the penalty of rape, but it shall be lawful for him to have her to wife.

[199:66] XXVI.

[199:67] Fornication is not wedlock, nor yet the beginning of wedlock.

[199:68] Wherefore it is best, if possible, to put asunder those who are united in fornication.

[199:69] If they are set on cohabitation, let them admit the penalty of fornication.

[199:70] Let them be allowed to live together, lest a worse thing happen.

[199:71] XXVII.

[199:72] As to the priest ignorantly involved in an illegal marriage, I have made the fitting regulation, that he may hold his seat, but must abstain from other functions.

[199:73] For such a case pardon is enough.

[199:74] It is unreasonable that the man who has to treat his own wounds should be blessing another, for benediction is the imparting of holiness.

[199:75] How can he who through his fault, committed in ignorance, is without holiness, impart it to another? Let him bless neither in public nor in private, nor distribute the body of Christ to others, nor perform any other sacred function, but, content with his seat of honour, let him beseech the Lord with weeping, that his sin, committed in ignorance, may be forgiven.

[199:76] XXVIII.

[199:77] It has seemed to me ridiculous that any one should make a vow to abstain from swine's flesh.

[199:78] Be so good as to teach men to abstain from foolish vows and promises.

[199:79] Represent the use to be quite indifferent.

[199:80] No creature of God, received with thanksgiving, is to be rejected.

[199:81] The vow is ridiculous; the abstinence unnecessary.

[199:82] XXIX.

[199:83] It is especially desirable that attention should be given to the case of persons in power who threaten on oath to do some hurt to those under their authority.

[199:84] The remedy is twofold.

[199:85] In the first place, let them be taught not to take oaths at random: secondly, not to persist in their wicked determinations.

[199:86] Any one who is arrested in the design of fulfilling an oath to injure another ought to shew repentance for the rashness of his oath, and must not confirm his wickedness under the pretext of piety.

[199:87] Herod was none the better for fulfilling his oath, when, of course only to save himself from perjury, he became the prophet's murderer.

[199:88] Swearing is absolutely forbidden, and it is only reasonable that the oath which tends to evil should be condemned.

[199:89] The swearer must therefore change his mind, and not persist in confirming his impiety.

[199:90] Consider the absurdity of the thing a little further.

[199:91] Suppose a man to swear that he will put his brother's eyes out: is it well for him to carry his oath into action? Or to commit murder? or to break any other commandment? "I have sworn, and I will perform it," not to sin, but to "keep thy righteous judgments".

[199:92] It is no less our duty to undo and destroy sin, than it is to confirm the commandment by immutable counsels.

[199:93] XXX.

[199:94] As to those guilty of abduction we have no ancient rule, but I have expressed my own judgment.

[199:95] The period is three years; the culprits and their accomplices to be excluded from service.

[199:96] The act committed without violence is not liable to punishment, whenever it has not been preceded by violation or robbery.

[199:97] The widow is independent, and to follow or not is in her own power.

[199:98] We must, therefore, pay no heed to excuses.

[199:99] XXXI.

[199:100] A woman whose husband has gone away and disappeared, and who marries another, before she has evidence of his death, commits adultery.

[199:101] Clerics who are guilty of the sin unto death are degraded from their order, but not excluded from the communion of the laity.

[199:102] Thou shalt not punish twice for the same fault.

[199:103] XXXIII.

[199:104] Let an indictment for murder be preferred against the woman who gives birth to a child on the road and pays no attention to it.

[199:105] XXXIV.

[199:106] Women who had committed adultery, and confessed their fault through piety, or were in any way convicted, were not allowed by our fathers to be publicly exposed, that we might not cause their death after conviction.

[199:107] But they ordered that they should be excluded from communion till they had fulfilled their term of penance.

[199:108] XXXV.

[199:109] In the case of a man deserted by his wife, the cause of the desertion must be taken into account.

[199:110] If she appear to have abandoned him without reason, he is deserving of pardon, but the wife of punishment.

[199:111] Pardon will be given to him that he may communicate with the Church.

[199:112] XXXVI.

[199:113] Soldiers' wives who have married in their husbands' absence will come under the same principle as wives who, when their husbands have been on a journey, have not waited their return.

[199:114] Their case, however, does admit of some concession on the ground of there being greater reason to suspect death.

[199:115] XXXVII.

[199:116] The man who marries after abducting another man's wife will incur the charge of adultery for the first case; but for the second will go free.

[199:117] XXXVIII.

[199:118] Girls who follow against their fathers' will commit fornication; but if their fathers are reconciled to them, the act seems to admit of a remedy.

[199:119] They are not however immediately restored to communion, but are to be punished for three years.

[199:120] XXXIX.

[199:121] The woman who lives with an adulterer is an adulteress the whole time.

[199:122] XL.

[199:123] The woman who yields to a man against her master's will commits fornication; but if afterwards she accepts free marriage, she marries.

[199:124] The former case is fornication; the latter marriage.

[199:125] The covenants of persons who are not independent have no validity.

[199:126] XLI.

[199:127] The woman in widowhood, who is independent, may dwell with a husband without blame, if there is no one to prevent their cohabitation; for the Apostle says; "but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord".

[199:128] XLII.

[199:129] Marriages contracted without the permission of those in authority, are fornication.

[199:130] If neither father nor master be living the contracting parties are free from blame; just as if the authorities assent to the cohabitation, it assumes the fixity of marriage.

[199:131] XLIII.

[199:132] He who smites his neighbour to death is a murderer, whether he struck first or in self defence.

[199:133] XLIV.

[199:134] The deaconess who commits fornication with a heathen may be received into repentance and will be admitted to the oblation in the seventh year; of course if she be living in chastity.

[199:135] The heathen who, after he has believed, takes to idolatry, returns to his vomit.

[199:136] We do not, however, give up the body of the deaconess to the use of the flesh, as being consecrated.

[199:137] XLV.

[199:138] If any one, after taking the name of Christianity, insults Christ, he gets no good from the name.

[199:139] XLVI.

[199:140] The woman who unwillingly marries a man deserted at the time by his wife, and is afterwards repudiated, because of the return of the former to him, commits fornication, but involuntarily.

[199:141] She will, therefore, not be prohibited from marriage; but it is better if she remain as she is.

[199:142] XLVII.

[199:143] Encratitae, Saccophori, and Apotactitae are not regarded in the same manner as Novatians, since in their case a canon has been pronounced, although different; while of the former nothing has been said.

[199:144] All these I re-baptize on the same principle.

[199:145] If among you their re-baptism is forbidden, for the sake of some arrangement, nevertheless let my principle prevail.

[199:146] Their heresy is, as it were, an offshoot of the Marcionites, abominating, as they do, marriage, refusing wine, and calling God's creature polluted.

[199:147] We do not therefore receive them into the Church, unless they be baptized into our baptism.

[199:148] Let them not say that they have been baptized into Father, Son and Holy Ghost, inasmuch as they make God the author of evil, after the example of Marcion and the rest of the heresies.

[199:149] Wherefore, if this be determined on, more bishops ought to meet together in one place and publish the canon in these terms, that action may be taken without peril, and authority given to answers to questions of this kind.

[199:150] XLVIII.

[199:151] The woman who has been abandoned by her husband, ought, in my judgment, to remain as she is.

[199:152] The Lord said, "If any one leave his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, he causeth her to commit adultery;" thus, by calling her adulteress, He excludes her from intercourse with another man.

[199:153] For how can the man being guilty, as having caused adultery, and the woman, go without blame, when she is called adulteress by the Lord for having intercourse with another man?  XLIX.

[199:154] Suffering violation should not be a cause of condemnation.

[199:155] So the slave girl, if she has been forced by her own master, is free from blame.

[199:156] L.

[199:157] There is no law as to trigamy: a third marriage is not contracted by law.

[199:158] We look upon such things as the defilements of the Church.

[199:159] But we do not subject them to public condemnation, as being better than unrestrained fornication.

[200:1] Letter CC.

[200:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[200:3] I am attacked by sickness after sickness, and all the work given me, not only by the affairs of the Church, but by those who are troubling the Church, has detained me during the whole winter, and up to the present time.

[200:4] It has been therefore quite impossible for me to send any one to you or to pay you a visit.

[200:5] I conjecture that you are similarly situated; not, indeed, as to sickness, God forbid; may the Lord grant you continued health for carrying out His commandments.

[200:6] But I know that the care of the Churches gives you the same distress as it does me.

[200:7] I was now about to send some one to get me accurate information about your condition.

[200:8] But when my well beloved son Meletius, who is moving the newly enlisted troops, reminded me of the opportunity of my saluting you by him, I gladly accepted the occasion to write and had recourse to the kind services of the conveyor of my letter.

[200:9] He is one who may himself serve instead of a letter, both because of his amiable disposition, and of his being well acquainted with all which concerns me.

[200:10] By him, then, I beseech your reverence especially to pray for me, that the Lord may grant to me a riddance from this troublesome body of mine; to His Churches, peace; and to you, rest; and, whenever you have settled the affairs of Lycaonia in apostolic fashion, as you have began, an opportunity to visit also this place.

[200:11] Whether I be sojourning in the flesh, or shall have been already bidden to take my departure to the Lord, I hope that you will interest yourself in our part of the world, as your own, as indeed it is, strengthening all that is weak, rousing all that is slothful and, by the help of the Spirit Which abides in you, transforming everything into a condition well pleasing to the Lord.

[200:12] My very honourable sons, Meletius and Melitius, whom you have known for some time, and know to be devoted to yourself, keep in your good care and pray for them.

[200:13] This is enough to keep them in safety.

[200:14] Salute in my name, I beg you, all who are with your holiness, both all the clergy, and all the laity under your pastoral care, and my very religious brothers and fellow ministers.

[200:15] Bear in mind the memory of the blessed martyr Eupsychius, and do not wait for me to mention him again.

[200:16] Do not take pains to come on the exact day, but anticipate it, and so give me joy, if I be yet living on this earth.

[200:17] Till then may you, by the grace of the Holy One, be preserved for me and for God's Churches, enjoying health and wealth in the Lord, and praying for me.

[201:1] Letter CCI.

[201:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[201:3] I long to meet you for many reasons, that I may have the benefit of your advice in the matters I had in hand, and that on beholding you after a long interval I may have some comfort for your absence.

[201:4] But since both of us are prevented by the same reasons, you by the illness which has befallen you, and I by the malady of longer standing which has not yet left me, let us, if you will, each forgive the other, that both may free ourselves from blame.

[202:1] Letter CCII.

[202:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[202:3] Under other circumstances I should think it a special privilege to meet with your reverence, but above all now, when the business which brings us together is of such great importance.

[202:4] But so much of my illness as still clings to me is enough to prevent my stirring ever so short a distance.

[202:5] I tried to drive as far as the martyrs and had a relapse almost into my old state.

[202:6] You must therefore forgive me.

[202:7] If the matter can be put off for a few days, I will, by God's grace join you, and share your anxieties.

[202:8] If the business presses, do, by God's help, what has to be done; but reckon me as present with you and as participating in your worthy deeds.

[202:9] May you, by the grace of the Holy One, be preserved to God's Church, strong and joyous in the Lord, and praying for me.

[203:1] Letter CCIII.

[203:2] To the bishops of the sea coast.

[203:3] I have had a strong desire to meet you, but from time to time some hindrance has supervened and prevented my fulfilling my purpose.

[203:4] I have either been hindered by sickness, and you know well how, from my early manhood to my present old age, this ailment has been my constant companion, brought up with me, and chastising me, by the righteous judgment of God, Who ordains all things in wisdom; or by the cares of the Church, or by struggles with the opponents of the doctrines of truth.

[203:5] [Up to this day I live in much affliction and grief, having the feeling present before me, that you are wanting to me.

[203:6] For when God tells me, who took on Him His sojourn in the flesh for the very purpose that, by patterns of duty, He might regulate our life, and might by His own voice announce to us the Gospel of the kingdom,—when He says, 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another,' and whereas the Lord left His own peace to His disciples as a farewell gift, when about to complete the dispensation in the flesh, saying, 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give you,' I cannot persuade myself that without love to others, and without, as far as rests with me, peaceableness towards all, I can be called a worthy servant of Jesus Christ.

[203:7] I have waited a long while for the chance of your love paying us a visit.

[203:8] For ye are not ignorant that we, being exposed to all, as rocks running out in the sea, sustain the fury of the heretical waves, which, in that they break around us, do not cover the district behind.

[203:9] I say "we" in order to refer it, not to human power, but to the grace of God, Who, by the weakness of men shows His power, as says the prophet in the person of the Lord, 'Will ye not fear Me, who have placed the sand as a boundary to the sea?' for by the weakest and most contemptible of all things, the sand, the Mighty One has bounded the great and full sea.

[203:10] Since, then, this is our position, it became your love to be frequent in sending true brothers to visit us who labour with the storm, and more frequently letters of love, partly to confirm our courage, partly to correct any mistake of ours.

[203:11] For we confess that we are liable to numberless mistakes, being men, and living in the flesh.

[203:12] ]  2.

[203:13] But hitherto, very honourable brethren, you have not given me my due; and this for two reasons.

[203:14] Either you failed to perceive the proper course; or else, under the influence of some of the calumnies spread abroad about me, you did not think me deserving of being visited by you in love.

[203:15] Now, therefore, I myself take the initiative.

[203:16] I beg to state that I am perfectly ready to rid myself, in your presence, of the charges urged against me, but only on condition that my revilers are admitted to stand face to face with me before your reverences.

[203:17] If I am convicted, I shall not deny my error.

[203:18] You, after the conviction, will receive pardon from the Lord for withdrawing yourselves from the communion of me a sinner.

[203:19] The successful accusers, too, will have their reward in the publication of my secret wickedness.

[203:20] If, however, you condemn me before you have the evidence before you, I shall be none the worse, barring the loss I shall sustain of a possession I hold most dear—your love: while you, for your part, will suffer the same loss in losing me, and will seem to be running counter to the words of the Gospel: "Doth our law judge any man before it hear him?" The reviler, moreover, if he adduce no proof of what he says, will be shewn to have got nothing from his wicked language but a bad name for himself.

[203:21] For what name can be properly applied to the slanderer except that which he professes to bear by the very conduct of which he is guilty? Let the reviler, therefore, appear not as slanderer, but as accuser; nay, I will not call him accuser, I will rather regard him as a brother, admonishing in love, and producing conviction for my amendment.

[203:22] And you must not be hearers of calumny, but triers of proof.

[203:23] Nor must I be left uncured, because my sin is not being made manifest.

[203:24] [3.

[203:25] Let not this consideration influence you.

[203:26] 'We dwell on the sea, we are exempt from the sufferings of the generality, we need no succour from others; so what is the good to us of foreign communion?' For the same Lord Who divided the islands from the continent by the sea, bound the island Christians to those of the continent by love.

[203:27] Nothing, brethren, separates us from each other, but deliberate estrangement.

[203:28] We have one Lord, one faith, the same hope.

[203:29] The hands need each other; the feet steady each other.

[203:30] The eyes possess their clear apprehension from agreement.

[203:31] We, for our part, confess our own weakness, and we seek your fellow feeling.

[203:32] For we are assured, that though ye are not present in body, yet by the aid of prayer, ye will do us much benefit in these most critical times.

[203:33] It is neither decorous before men, nor pleasing to God, that you should make avowals which not even the Gentiles adopt, which know not God.

[203:34] Even they, as we hear, though the country they live in be sufficient for all things, yet, on account of the uncertainty of the future, make much of alliances with each other, and seek mutual intercourse as being advantageous to them.

[203:35] Yet we, the sons of fathers who have laid down the law that by brief notes the proofs of communion should be carried about from one end of the earth to the other, and that all should be citizens and familiars with all, now sever ourselves from the whole world, and are neither ashamed at our solitariness, nor shudder that on us is fallen the fearful prophecy of the Lord, 'Because of lawlessness abounding, the love of the many shall wax cold.

[203:36] ']  4.

[203:37] Do not, most honourable brethren, do not suffer this.

[203:38] Rather, by letters of peace and by salutations of love, comfort me for the past.

[203:39] You have made a wound in my heart by your former neglect.

[203:40] Soothe its anguish, as it were, by a tender touch.

[203:41] Whether you wish to come to me, and examine for yourselves into the truth of what you hear of my infirmities, or whether by the addition of more lies my sins are reported to you to be yet more grievous, I must accept even this.

[203:42] I am ready to welcome you with open hands and to offer myself to the strictest test, only let love preside over the proceedings.

[203:43] Or if you prefer to indicate any spot in your own district to which I may come and pay you the visit which is due, submitting myself, as far as may be, to examination, for the healing of the past, and the prevention of slander for the future, I accept this.

[203:44] Although my flesh is weak, yet, as long as I breathe, I am responsible for the due discharge of every duty which may tend to the edification of the Churches of Christ.

[203:45] Do not, I beseech you, make light of my entreaty.

[203:46] Do not force me to disclose my distress to others.

[203:47] Hitherto, brethren, as you are well aware, I have kept my grief to myself, for I blush to speak of your alienation from me to those of our communion who are at a distance.

[203:48] I shrink at once from paining them and from gratifying those who hate me.

[203:49] I alone am writing this now; but I send in the name of all the brethren in Cappadocia, who have charged me not to employ any chance messenger, but some one who, in case I should, from my anxiety not to be too prolix, leave out any points of importance, might supply them with the intelligence wherewith God has gifted him.

[203:50] I refer to my beloved and reverend fellow presbyter Petrus.

[203:51] Welcome him in love, and send him forth to me in peace, that he may be a messenger to me of good things.

[204:1] Letter CCIV.

[204:2] To the Neocaesareans.

[204:3] 1.

[204:4] [There has been a long silence on both sides, revered and well-beloved brethren, just as if there were angry feelings between us.

[204:5] Yet who is there so sullen and implacable towards the party which has injured him, as to lengthen out the resentment which has begun in disgust through almost a whole life of man?] This [is happening in our case, no just occasion of estrangement existing, as far as I myself know, but on the contrary, there being, from the first, many strong reasons for the closest friendship and unity.

[204:6] The greatest and first is this, our Lord's command, pointedly saying, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another".

[204:7] ] Again, the apostle clearly sets before us the good of charity where he tells us that love is the fulfilling of the law; and again where he says that charity is a good thing to be preferred to all great and good things, in the words, "Though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.

[204:8] And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

[204:9] And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burnt and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing".

[204:10] Not that each of the points enumerated could be performed without love, but that the Holy One wishes, as He Himself has said, to attribute to the commandment super-eminent excellency by the figure of hyperbole.

[204:11] 2.

[204:12] [Next, if it tend much towards intimacy to have the same teachers, there are to you and to me the same teachers of God's mysteries, and spiritual Fathers, who from the beginning were the founders of your Church.

[204:13] I mean the great Gregory, and all who succeeding in order to the throne of your episcopate, like stars rising one after another, have tracked the same course, so as to leave the tokens of the heavenly polity most clear to all who desire them.

[204:14] ] And if natural relationships are not to be despised, but are greatly conducive to unbroken union and fellowship, these rights also exist naturally for you and me.

[204:15] [Why is it, then, O venerable among cities, for through you I address the whole city, that no civil writing comes from you, no welcome voice, but your ears are open to those who aim at slander?] I am therefore the more bound to groan, the more I perceive the end they have in view.

[204:16] There is no doubt as to who is the originator of the slander.

[204:17] He is known by many evil deeds, but is best distinguished by this particular wickedness, and it is for this reason that the sin is made his name.

[204:18] But you must put up with my plain speaking.

[204:19] You have opened both ears to my slanderers.

[204:20] You heartily welcome all you hear without any enquiry.

[204:21] Not one of you distinguishes between lies and truth.

[204:22] Who ever suffered for lack of wicked accusations when struggling all alone? Who was ever convicted of lying in the absence of his victim? What plea does not sound plausible to the hearers when the reviler persists that such and such is the case, and the reviled is neither present nor hears what is urged against him? Does not even the accepted custom of this world teach you, in reference to these matters, that if any one is to be a fair and impartial hearer, he must not be entirely led away by the first speaker, but must wait for the defence of the accused, that so truth may be demonstrated by a comparison of the arguments on both sides? "Judge righteous judgment".

[204:23] This precept is one of those most necessary for salvation.

[204:24] 3.

[204:25] When I say this I am not forgetful of the words of the Apostle, who fled from human tribunals and reserved the defence of all his life for the unerring judgment seat, when he said, "With me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment".

[204:26] Your ears have been preoccupied by lying slanders, slanders that have touched my conduct, slanders that have touched my faith in God.

[204:27] Nevertheless, knowing, as I do, that three persons at once are injured by the slanderer, his victim, his hearer, and himself; as to my own wrong, I would have held my tongue, be sure; not because I despise your good opinion, (how could I, writing now as I do and earnestly pleading as I do that I may not lose it?) but because I see that of the three sufferers the one who is least injured is myself.

[204:28] It is true that I shall be robbed of you, but you are being robbed of the truth, and he who is at the bottom of all this is parting me from you, but he is alienating himself from the Lord, inasmuch as no one can be brought near to the Lord by doing what is forbidden.

[204:29] Rather then for your sakes than for mine, rather to rescue you from unendurable wrong am I pleading.

[204:30] For who could suffer a worse calamity than the loss of the most precious of all things, the truth?  4.

[204:31] [What say I, brethren? Not that I am a sinless person; not that my life is not full of numberless faults.

[204:32] I know myself; and indeed I cease not my tears for my sins, if by any means I may be able to appease my God, and to escape the punishment threatened against them.

[204:33] But this I say: let him who judges me, hunt for motes in my eye, if he can say that his own is clear.

[204:34] ] I own, brethren, that I need the care of the sound and healthy, and need much of it.

[204:35] If he cannot say that it is clear, and the clearer it is the less will he say so—(for it is the part of the perfect not to exalt themselves; if they do they will certainly come under the charge of the pride of the Pharisee, who, while justifying himself, condemned the publican) let him come with me to the physician; let him not "judge before the time until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts".

[204:36] Let him remember the words, "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged;" and "Condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned".

[204:37] [In a word, brethren, if my offences admit of cure, why does not such an one obey the teacher of the Churches, "Reprove, exhort, rebuke"? If, on the other hand, my iniquity be past cure, why does he not withstand me to the face, and, by publishing my transgressions, deliver the Churches from the mischief which I bring on them?] Do not put up with the calumny uttered against me within the teeth.

[204:38] This is the abuse which any slave-girl from the grindstone might utter; this is the kind of fine shewing-off you might expect from any street vagabond; their tongues are whetted for any slander.

[204:39] But [there are bishops; let appeal be made to them.

[204:40] There is a clergy in each of God's dioceses; let the most eminent be assembled.

[204:41] Let whoso will, speak freely, that I may have to deal with a charge, not a slander.

[204:42] ] Let my secret wickedness be brought into full view; let me no longer be hated, but admonished as a brother.

[204:43] It is more just that we sinners should be pitied by the blessed and the sinless, than that we should be treated angrily.

[204:44] 5.

[204:45] [If the fault be a point of faith, let the document be pointed out to me.

[204:46] Again, let a fair and impartial inquiry be appointed.

[204:47] Let the accusation be read; let it be brought to the test, whether it does not arise from ignorance in the accuser, not from blame in the matter of the writing.

[204:48] For right things often do not seem such to those who are deficient in accurate judgment.

[204:49] Equal weights seem unequal when the arms of the balance are of different sizes.

[204:50] ] Men whose sense of taste is destroyed by sickness, sometimes think honey sour.

[204:51] A diseased eye does not see many things which do exist, and notes many things which do not exist.

[204:52] The same thing frequently takes place with regard to the force of words, when the critic is inferior to the writer.

[204:53] The critic ought really to set out with much the same training and equipment as the author.

[204:54] A man ignorant of agriculture is quite incapable of criticising husbandry, and the distinctions between harmony and discord can only be adequately judged by a trained musician.

[204:55] But any one who chooses will set up for a literary critic, though he cannot tell us where he went to school, or how much time was spent in his education, and knows nothing about letters at all.

[204:56] I see clearly that, even in the case of the words of the Holy Spirit, the investigation of the terms is to be attempted not by every one, but by him who has the spirit of discernment, as the Apostle has taught us, in the differences of gifts;—"For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gift of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits".

[204:57] If, therefore, my gifts are spiritual, he who wishes to judge them must shew proof of his own possession of the gift of "discerning of spirits".

[204:58] If, on the contrary, as he calumniously contends, my gifts are of the wisdom of this world, let him shew that he is an adept in this world's wisdom, and I will submit myself to his verdict.

[204:59] And [let no one suppose that I am making excuses to evade the charge.

[204:60] I put it into your hands, dearest brethren, to investigate for yourselves the points alleged against me.

[204:61] Are you so slow of intelligence as to be wholly dependent upon advocates for the discovery of the truth? If the points in question seem to you to be quite plain of themselves, persuade the jesters to drop the dispute.

[204:62] [If there be anything you do not understand, put questions to me, through appointed persons who will do justice to me; or ask of me explanations in writing.

[204:63] And take all kinds of pains that nothing may be left unsifted.

[204:64] 6.

[204:65] What clearer evidence can there be of my faith, than that I was brought up by my grandmother, blessed woman, who came from you? I mean the celebrated Macrina who taught me the words of the blessed Gregory; which, as far as memory had preserved down to her day, she cherished herself, while she fashioned and formed me, while yet a child, upon the doctrines of piety.

[204:66] And when I gained the capacity of thought, my reason being matured by full age, I travelled over much sea and land, and whomsoever I found walking in the rule of godliness delivered, those I set down as fathers,] and made them my soul's guides in my journey to God.

[204:67] And up to this day, by the grace of Him who has called me in His holy calling to the knowledge of Himself, I know of no doctrine opposed to the sound teaching having sunk into my heart; nor was my soul ever polluted by the ill-famed blasphemy of Arius.

[204:68] If I have ever received into communion any who have come from that teacher, hiding their unsoundness deep within them, or speaking words of piety, or, at any rate, not opposing what has been said by me, it is on these terms that I have admitted them; and I have not allowed my judgment concerning them to rest wholly with myself, but have followed the decisions given about them by our Fathers.

[204:69] For after receiving the letter of the very blessed Father Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, which I hold in my hand, and shew to any one who asks, wherein he has distinctly declared that any one expressing a wish to come over from the heresy of the Arians and accepting the Nicene Creed, is to be received without hesitation and difficulty, citing in support of his opinion the unanimous assent of the bishops of Macedonia and of Asia; I, considering myself bound to follow the high authority of such a man and of those who made the rule, and with every desire on my own part to win the reward promised to peacemakers, did enroll in the lists of communicants all who accepted that creed.

[204:70] 7.

[204:71] [The fair thing would be to judge of me, not from one or two who do not walk uprightly in the truth, but from the multitude of bishops throughout the world, connected with me by the grace of the Lord.

[204:72] Make enquiries of Pisidians, Lycaonians, Isaurians, Phrygians of both provinces, Armenians your neighbours, Macedonians, Achaeans, Illyrians, Gauls, Spaniards, the whole of Italy, Sicilians, Africans, the healthy part of Egypt, whatever is left of Syria; all of whom send letters to me, and in turn receive them from me.

[204:73] ] From these letters, alike from all which are despatched from them.

[204:74] and from all which go out from us to them, you may learn that we are all of one mind, and of one opinion.

[204:75] [Whoso shuns communion with me, it cannot escape your accuracy, cuts himself off from the whole Church.

[204:76] Look round about, brethren, with whom do you hold communion? If you will not receive it from me, who remains to acknowledge you? Do not reduce me to the necessity of counselling anything unpleasant concerning a Church so dear to me.

[204:77] ] There are things now which I hide in the bottom of my heart, in secret groaning over and bewailing the evil days in which we live, in that the greatest Churches which have long been united to one another in brotherly love, now, without any reason, are in mutual opposition.

[204:78] Do not, oh! do not, drive me to complain of these things to all who are in communion with me.

[204:79] Do not force me to give utterance to words which hitherto I have kept in check by reflection and have hidden in my heart.

[204:80] Better were it for me to be removed and the Churches to be at one, than that God's people should suffer such evil through our childish ill-will.

[204:81] [Ask your fathers, and they will tell you that though our districts were divided in position, yet in mind they were one, and were governed by one sentiment.

[204:82] Intercourse of the people was frequent; frequent the visits of the clergy; the pastors, too, had such mutual affection, that each used the other as teacher and guide in things pertaining to the Lord.

[204:83] ].

[205:1] Letter CCV.

[205:2] To Elpidius the bishop.

[205:3] Once again I have started the well-beloved presbyter Meletius to carry my greeting to you.

[205:4] I had positively determined to spare him, on account of the weakness which he has voluntarily brought upon himself, by bringing his body into subjection for the sake of the gospel of Christ.

[205:5] But I have judged it fitting to salute you by the ministry of such men as he is, able to supply of themselves all the shortcomings of my letter, and to become, alike to writer and recipient, a kind of living epistle.

[205:6] I am also carrying out the very strong wish, which he has always had, to see your excellency, ever since he has had experience of the high qualities you possess.

[205:7] So now I have besought him to travel to you, and through him I discharge the debt of the visit I owe you, and beseech you to pray for me and for the Church of God, that the Lord may grant me deliverance from the injuries of the enemies of the Gospel, and to pass my life in peace and quiet.

[205:8] Nevertheless, if you in your wisdom, think it needful that we should travel to the same spot, and meet the rest of our right honourable brother bishops of the sea board regions, do you yourself point out a suitable place and time where and when this meeting may take place.

[205:9] Write to our brethren to the end that each and all may, at the appointed time, leave the business they may have in hand, and may be able to effect something for the edification of the Churches of God, do away with the pain which we now suffer from our mutual suspicions, and establish love, without which the Lord Himself has ordained that obedience to every commandment must be of none effect.

[206:1] Letter CCVI.

[206:2] To Elpidius the bishop.

[206:3] Consolatory.

[206:4] Now, most of all, do I feel my bodily infirmity, when I see how it stands in the way of my soul's good.

[206:5] Had matters gone as I hoped, I should not now be speaking to you by letter or by messenger, but should in my own person have been paying the debt of affection and enjoying spiritual advantage face to face.

[206:6] Now, however, I am so situated that I am only too glad if I am able even to move about in my own country in the necessary visitation of parishes in my district.

[206:7] But may the Lord grant to you both strength and a ready will, and to me, in addition to my eager desire, ability to enjoy your society when I am in the country of Comana.

[206:8] I am afraid lest your domestic trouble may be some hindrance to you.

[206:9] For I have learnt of your affliction in the loss of your little boy.

[206:10] To a grandfather his death cannot but be grievous.

[206:11] On the other hand to a man who has attained to so high a degree of virtue, and alike from his experience of this world and his spiritual training knows what human nature is, it is natural that the removal of those who are near and dear should not be wholly intolerable.

[206:12] The Lord requires from us what He does not require from every one.

[206:13] The common mass of mankind lives by habit, but the Christian's rule of life is the commandment of the Lord, and the example of holy men of old, whose greatness of soul was, above all, exhibited in adversity.

[206:14] To the end, then, that you may yourself leave to them that come after you an example of fortitude and of genuine trust in what we hope for, show that you are not vanquished by your grief, but are rising above your sorrows, patient in affliction, and rejoicing in hope.

[206:15] Pray let none of these things be a hindrance to our hoped for meeting.

[206:16] Children, indeed, are held blameless on account of their tender age; but you and I are under the responsibility of serving the Lord, as He commands us, and in all things to be ready for the administration of the affairs of the Churches.

[206:17] For the due discharge of that duty the Lord has reserved great rewards for faithful and wise stewards.

[207:1] Letter CCVII.

[207:2] To the clergy of Neocaesarea.

[207:3] You all concur in hating me.

[207:4] To a man you have followed the leader of the war against me.

[207:5] I was therefore minded to say not a word to any one.

[207:6] I determined that I would write no friendly letter; that I would start no communication, but keep my sorrow in silence to myself.

[207:7] Yet it is wrong to keep silence in the face of calumny; not that by contradiction we may vindicate ourselves, but that we may not allow a lie to travel further and its victims to be harmed.

[207:8] I have therefore thought it necessary to put this matter also before you all, and to write a letter to you, although, when I recently wrote to all the presbyterate in common, you did not do me the honour to send me a reply.

[207:9] Do not, my brethren, gratify the vanity of those who are filling your minds with pernicious opinions.

[207:10] Do not consent to look lightly on, when, to your knowledge, God's people are being subverted by impious teaching.

[207:11] None but Sabellius the Libyan and Marcellus the Galatian have dared to teach and write what the leaders of your people are attempting to bring forward among you as their own private discovery.

[207:12] They are making a great talk about it, but they are perfectly powerless to give their sophisms and fallacies even any colour of truth.

[207:13] In their harangues against me they shrink from no wickedness, and persistently refuse to meet me.

[207:14] Why? Is it not because they are afraid of being convicted for their own wicked opinions? Yes; and in their attacks upon me they have become so lost to all sense of shame as to invent certain dreams to my discredit while they falsely accuse my teaching of being pernicious.

[207:15] Let them take upon their own heads all the visions of the autumn months; they can fix no blasphemy on me, for in every Church there are many to testify to the truth.

[207:16] 2.

[207:17] When they are asked the reason for this furious and truceless war, they allege psalms and a kind of music varying from the custom which has obtained among you, and similar pretexts of which they ought to be ashamed.

[207:18] We are, moreover, accused because we maintain men in the practice of true religion who have renounced the world and all those cares of this life, which the Lord likens to thorns that do not allow the word to bring forth fruit.

[207:19] Men of this kind carry about in the body the deadness of Jesus; they have taken up their own cross, and are followers of God.

[207:20] I would gladly give my life if these really were my faults, and if I had men with me owning me as teacher who had chosen this ascetic life.

[207:21] I hear that virtue of this kind is to be found now in Egypt, and there are, peradventure, some men in Palestine whose conversation follows the precepts of the Gospel.

[207:22] I am told too that some perfect and blessed men are to be found in Mesopotamia.

[207:23] We, in comparison with the perfect, are children.

[207:24] But if women also have chosen to live the Gospel life, preferring virginity to wedlock, leading captive the lust of the flesh, and living in the mourning which is called blessed, they are blessed in their profession wherever they are to be found.

[207:25] We, however, have few instances of this to show, for with us people are still in an elementary stage and are being gradually brought.

[207:26] to piety.

[207:27] If any charges of disorder are brought against the life of our women I do not undertake to defend them.

[207:28] One thing, however, I do say and that is, that these bold hearts, these unbridled mouths are ever fearlessly uttering what Satan, the father of lies, has hitherto been unable to say.

[207:29] I wish you to know that we rejoice to have assemblies of both men and women, whose conversation is in heaven and who have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof; they take no thought for food and raiment, but remain undisturbed beside their Lord, continuing night and day in prayer.

[207:30] Their lips speak not of the deeds of men: they sing hymns to God continually, working with their own hands that they may have to distribute to them that need.

[207:31] 3.

[207:32] Now as to the charge relating to the singing of psalms, whereby my calumniators specially scare the simpler folk, my reply is this.

[207:33] The customs which now obtain are agreeable to those of all the Churches of God.

[207:34] Among us the people go at night to the house of prayer, and, in distress, affliction, and continual tears, making confession to God, at last rise from their prayers and begin to sing psalms.

[207:35] And now, divided into two parts, they sing antiphonally with one another, thus at once confirming their study of the Gospels, and at the same time producing for themselves a heedful temper and a heart free from distraction.

[207:36] Afterwards they again commit the prelude of the strain to one, and the rest take it up; and so after passing the night in various psalmody, praying at intervals as the day begins to dawn, all together, as with one voice and one heart, raise the psalm of confession to the Lord, each forming for himself his own expressions of penitence.

[207:37] If it is for these reasons that you renounce me, you will renounce the Egyptians; you will renounce both Libyans, Thebans, Palestinians, Arabians, Phoenicians, Syrians, the dwellers by the Euphrates; in a word all those among whom vigils, prayers, and common psalmody have been held in honour.

[207:38] 4.

[207:39] But, it is alleged, these practices were not observed in the time of the great Gregory.

[207:40] My rejoinder is that even the Litanies which you now use were not used in his time.

[207:41] I do not say this to find fault with you; for my prayer would be that every one of you should live in tears and continual penitence.

[207:42] We, for our part, are always offering supplication for our sins, but we propitiate our God not as you do, in the words of mere man, but in the oracles of the Spirit.

[207:43] And what evidence have you that this custom was not followed in the time of the great Gregory? You have kept none of his customs up to the present time.

[207:44] Gregory did not cover his head at prayer.

[207:45] How could he? He was a true disciple of the Apostle who says, "Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head".

[207:46] And "a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image of God".

[207:47] Oaths were shunned by Gregory, that pure soul, worthy of the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, content with yea and nay, in accordance with the commandment of the Lord Who said, "I say unto you swear not at all".

[207:48] Gregory could not bear to call his brother a fool, for he stood in awe of the threat of the Lord.

[207:49] Passion, wrath, and bitterness never proceeded out of his mouth.

[207:50] Railing he hated, because it leads not to the kingdom of heaven.

[207:51] Envy and arrogance had been shut out of that guiltless soul.

[207:52] He would never have stood at the altar before being reconciled to his brother.

[207:53] A lie, or any word designed to slander any one, he abominated, as one who knew that lies come from the devil, and that the Lord will destroy all that utter a lie.

[207:54] If you have none of these things, and are clear of all, then are you verily disciples of the disciple of the Lord; if not, beware lest, in your disputes about the mode of singing psalms, you are straining at the gnat and setting at naught the greatest of the commandments.

[207:55] I have been driven to use these expressions by the urgency of my defence, that you may be taught to cast the beam out of your own eyes before you try to remove other men's motes.

[207:56] Nevertheless, I am conceding all, although there is nothing that is not searched into before God.

[207:57] Only let great matters prevail, and do not allow innovations in the faith to make themselves heard.

[207:58] Do not disregard the hypostases.

[207:59] Do not deny the name of Christ.

[207:60] Do not put a wrong meaning on the words of Gregory.

[207:61] If you do so, as long as I breathe and have the power of utterance, I cannot keep silence, when I see souls being thus destroyed.

[208:1] Letter CCVIII.

[208:2] To Eulancius.

[208:3] You have been long silent, though you have very great power of speech, and are well trained in the art of conversation and of exhibiting yourself by your eloquence.

[208:4] Possibly it is Neocaesarea which is the cause of your not writing to me.

[208:5] I suppose I must take it as a kindness if those who are there do not remember me, for, as I am informed by those who report what they hear, the mention made of me is not kind.

[208:6] You, however, used to be one of those who were disliked for my sake, not one of those who dislike me for the sake of others.

[208:7] I hope this description will continue to fit you, that wherever you are you will write to me, and will have kindly thoughts of me, if you care at all for what is fair and right.

[208:8] It is certainly fair that those who have been first to show affection should be paid in their own coin.

[209:1] Letter CCIX.

[209:2] Without address.

[209:3] It is your lot to share my distress, and to do battle on my behalf.

[209:4] Herein is proof of your manliness.

[209:5] God, who ordains our lives, grants to those who are capable of sustaining great fights greater opportunity of winning renown.

[209:6] You truly have risked your own life as a test of your valour in your friend's behalf, like gold in the furnace.

[209:7] I pray God that other men may be made better; that you may remain what you are, and that you will not cease to find fault with me, as you do, and to charge me with not writing often to you, as a wrong on my part which does you very great injury.

[209:8] This is an accusation only made by a friend.

[209:9] Persist in demanding the payment of such debts.

[209:10] I am not so very unreasonable in paying the claims of affection.

[210:1] Letter CCX.

[210:2] To the notables of Neocaesarea.

[210:3] I am really under no obligation to publish my own mind to you, or to state the reasons for my present sojourn where I am; it is not my custom to indulge in self advertisement, nor is the matter worth publicity.

[210:4] I am not, I think, following my own inclinations; I am answering the challenge of your leaders.

[210:5] I have always striven to be ignored more earnestly than popularity hunters strive after notoriety.

[210:6] But, I am told, the ears of everybody in your town are set a thrilling, while certain tale-mongers, creators of lies, hired for this very work, are giving you a history of me and my doings.

[210:7] I therefore do not think that I ought to overlook your being exposed to the teaching of vile intention and foul tongue; I think that I am bound to tell you myself in what position I am placed.

[210:8] From my childhood I have been familiar with this spot, for here I was brought up by my grandmother; hither I have often retreated, and here I have spent many years, when endeavouring to escape from the hubbub of public affairs, for experience has taught me that the quiet and solitude of the spot are favourable to serious thought.

[210:9] Moreover as my brothers are now living here, I have gladly retired to this retreat, and have taken a brief breathing time from the press of the labours that beset me, not as a centre from which I might give trouble to others, but to indulge my own longing.

[210:10] 2.

[210:11] Where then is the need of having recourse to dreams and of hiring their interpreters, and making me matter for talk over the cups at public entertainments? Had slander been launched against me in any other quarter, I should have called you to witness to prove what I think, and now I ask every one of you to remember those old days when I was invited by your city to take charge of the education of the young, and a deputation of the first men among you came to see me.

[210:12] Afterwards, when you all crowded round me, what were you not ready to give? what not to promise? Nevertheless you were not able to keep me.

[210:13] How then could I, who at that time would not listen when you invited me, now attempt to thrust myself on you uninvited? How could I, who when you complimented and admired me, avoided you, have been intending to court you now that you calumniate me? Nothing of the kind, sirs; I am not quite so cheap.

[210:14] No man in his senses would go on board a boat without a steersman, or get alongside a Church where the men sitting at the helm are themselves stirring up tempest and storm.

[210:15] Whose fault was it that the town was all full of tumult, when some were running away with no one after them, and others stealing off when no invader was near, and all the wizards and dream-tellers were flourishing their bogeys? Whose fault was it else? Does not every child know that it was the mob-leaders'? The reasons of their hatred to me it would be bad taste on my part to recount; but they are quite easy for you to apprehend.

[210:16] When bitterness and division have come to the last pitch of savagery, and the explanation of the cause is altogether groundless and ridiculous, then the mental disease is plain, dangerous indeed to other people's comfort, but greatly and personally calamitous to the patient.

[210:17] And there is one charming point about them.

[210:18] Torn and racked with inward agony as they are, they cannot yet for very shame speak out about it.

[210:19] The state they are in may be known not only from their behaviour to me, but from the rest of their conduct.

[210:20] If it were unknown, it would not much matter.

[210:21] But the veritable cause of their shunning communication with me may be unperceived by the majority among you.

[210:22] Listen; and I will tell you.

[210:23] 3.

[210:24] There is going on among you a movement ruinous to the faith, disloyal to the apostolical and evangelical dogmas, disloyal too to the tradition of Gregory the truly great, and of his successors up to the blessed Musonius, whose teaching is still ringing in your ears.

[210:25] For those men, who, from fear of confutation, are forging figments against me, are endeavouring to renew the old mischief of Sabellius, started long ago, and extinguished by the tradition of the great Gregory.

[210:26] But do you bid goodbye to those wine-laden heads, bemuddled by the swelling fumes that mount from their debauch, and from me who am wide awake and from fear of God cannot keep silence, hear what plague is rife among you.

[210:27] Sabellianism is Judaism imported into the preaching of the Gospel under the guise of Christianity.

[210:28] For if a man calls Father Son and Holy Ghost one thing of many faces, and makes the hypostasis of the three one, what is this but to deny the everlasting pre-existence of the Only begotten? He denies too the Lord's sojourn among men in the incarnation, the going down into hell, the resurrection, the judgment; he denies also the proper operations of the Spirit.

[210:29] And I hear that even rasher innovations than those of the foolish Sabellius are now ventured on among you.

[210:30] It is said, and that on the evidence of ear witnesses, that your clever men go to such an extreme as to say that there is no tradition of the name of the Only-begotten, while of the name of the adversary there is; and at this they are highly delighted and elated, as though it were a discovery of their own.

[210:31] For it is said, "I came in my Father's name and ye received me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive".

[210:32] And because it is said, "Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," it is obvious, they urge, that the name is one, for it is not "in the names," but "in the name".

[210:33] 4.

[210:34] I blush so to write to you, for the men thus guilty are of my own blood; and I groan for my own soul, in that, like boxers fighting two men at once, I can only give the truth its proper force by hitting with my proofs, and knocking down, the errors of doctrine on the right and on the left.

[210:35] On one side I am attacked by the Anomoean: on the other by the Sabellian.

[210:36] Do not, I implore you, pay any attention to these abominable and impotent sophisms.

[210:37] Know that the name of Christ which is above every name is His being called Son of God, as Peter says, "There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved".

[210:38] And as to the words "I came in my Father's name," it is to be understood that He so says describing His Father as origin and cause of Himself.

[210:39] And if it is said "Go and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost," we must not suppose that here one name is delivered to us.

[210:40] For just as he who said Paul and Silvanus and Timothy mentioned three names, and coupled them one to the other by the word "and," so He who spoke of the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, mentioned three, and united them by the conjunction, teaching that with each name must be understood its own proper meaning; for the names mean things.

[210:41] And no one gifted with even the smallest particle of intelligence doubts that the existence belonging to the things is peculiar and complete in itself.

[210:42] For of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost there is the same nature and one Godhead; but these are different names, setting forth to a us the circumscription and exactitude of the meanings.

[210:43] For unless the meaning of the distinctive qualities of each be unconfounded, it is impossible for the doxology to be adequately offered to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

[210:44] If, however, they deny that they so say, and so teach, my object is attained.

[210:45] Yet I see that this denial is no easy matter, because of our having many witnesses who heard these things said.

[210:46] But let bygones be bygones; let them only be sound now.

[210:47] If they persist in the same old error I must proclaim your calamity even to other Churches, and get letters written to you from more bishops.

[210:48] In my efforts to break down this huge mass of impiety now gradually and secretly growing, I shall either effect something towards the object I have in view; or at least my present testimony will clear me of guilt in the judgment day.

[210:49] 5.

[210:50] They have already inserted these expressions in their own writings.

[210:51] They sent them first to the man of God, Meletius, bishop, and after receiving from him a suitable reply, like mothers of monsters, ashamed of their natural deformities, these men themselves brought forth and bring up their disgusting offspring in appropriate darkness.

[210:52] They made an attempt too by letter on my dear friend Anthimus, bishop of Tyana, on the ground that Gregory had said in his exposition of the faith that Father and Son are in thought two, but in hypostasis one.

[210:53] The men who congratulate themselves on the subtilty of their intelligence could not perceive that this is said not in reference to dogmatic opinion, but in controversy with aelian.

[210:54] And in this dispute there are not a few copyists' blunders, as, please God, I shall shew in the case of the actual expressions used.

[210:55] But in his endeavour to convince the heathen, he deemed it needless to be nice about the words he employed; he judged it wiser sometimes to make concessions to the character of the subject who was being persuaded, so as not to run counter to the opportunity given him.

[210:56] This explains how it is that you may find there many expressions which now give great support to the heretics, as for instance "creature" and "thing made" and the like.

[210:57] But those who ignorantly criticise these writings refer to the question of the Godhead much that is said in reference to the conjunction with man; as is the case with this passage which they are hawking about.

[210:58] For it is indispensable to have clear understanding that, as he who fails to confess the community of the essence or substance falls into polytheism, so he who refuses to grant the distinction of the hypostases is carried away into Judaism.

[210:59] For we must keep our mind stayed, so to say, on certain underlying subject matter, and, by forming a clear impression of its distinguishing lines, so arrive at the end desired.

[210:60] For suppose we do not bethink us of the Fatherhood, nor bear in mind Him of whom this distinctive quality is marked off, how can we take in the idea of God the Father? For merely to enumerate the differences of Persons is insufficient; we must confess each Person to have a natural existence in real hypostasis.

[210:61] Now Sabellius did not even deprecate the formation of the persons without hypostasis, saying as he did that the same God, being one in matter, was metamorphosed as the need of the moment required, and spoken of now as Father, now as Son, and now as Holy Ghost.

[210:62] The inventors of this unnamed heresy are renewing the old long extinguished error; those, I mean, who are repudiating the hypostases, and denying the name of the Son of God.

[210:63] They must give over uttering iniquity against God, or they will have to wail with them that deny the Christ.

[210:64] 6.

[210:65] I have felt compelled to write to you in these terms, that you may be on your guard against the mischief arising from bad teaching.

[210:66] If we may indeed liken pernicious teachings to poisonous drugs, as your dream-tellers have it, these doctrines are hemlock and monkshood, or any other deadly to man.

[210:67] It is these that destroy souls; not my words, as this shrieking drunken scum, full of the fancies of their condition, make out.

[210:68] If they had any sense they ought to know that in souls, pure and cleansed from all defilement, the prophetic gift shines clear.

[210:69] In a foul mirror you cannot see what the reflexion is, neither can a soul preoccupied with cares of this life, and darkened with the passions of the lust of the flesh, receive the rays of the Holy Ghost.

[210:70] Every dream is not a prophecy, as says Zechariah, "The Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,…for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have told false dreams".

[210:71] Those who, as Isaiah says, dream and love to sleep in their bed forget that an operation of error is sent to "the children of disobedience".

[210:72] And there is a lying spirit, which arose in false prophecies, and deceived Ahab.

[210:73] Knowing this they ought not to have been so lifted up as to ascribe the gift of prophecy to themselves.

[210:74] They are shewn to fall far short even of the case of the seer Balaam; for Balaam when invited by the king of Moab with mighty bribes brooked not to utter a word beyond the will of God, nor to curse Israel whom the Lord cursed not.

[210:75] If then their sleep-fancies do not tally with the commandments of the Lord, let them be content with the Gospels.

[210:76] The Gospels need no dreams to add to their credit.

[210:77] The Lord has sent His peace to us, and left us a new commandment, to love one another, but dreams bring strife and division and destruction of love.

[210:78] Let them therefore not give occasion to the devil to attack their souls in sleep; nor make their imaginations of more authority than the instruction of salvation.

[211:1] Letter CCXI.

[211:2] To Olympius.

[211:3] Truly when I read your excellency's letter I felt unwonted pleasure and cheerfulness; and when I met your well-beloved sons, I seemed to behold yourself.

[211:4] They found me in the deepest affliction, but they so behaved as to make me forget the hemlock, which your dreamers and dream mongers are carrying about to my hurt, to please the people who have hired them.

[211:5] Some letters I have already sent; others, if you like, shall follow.

[211:6] I only hope that they may be of some advantage to the recipients.

[212:1] Letter CCXII.

[212:2] To Hilarius.

[212:3] 1.

[212:4] You can imagine what I felt, and in what state of mind I was, when I came to Dazimon and found that you had left a few days before my arrival.

[212:5] From my boyhood I have held you in admiration, and, therefore, ever since our old school days, have placed a high value on intercourse with you.

[212:6] But another reason for my doing so is that nothing is so precious now as a soul that loves the truth, and is gifted with a sound judgment in practical affairs.

[212:7] This, I think, is to be found in you.

[212:8] I see most men, as in the hippodrome, divided into factions, some for one side and some for another, and shouting with their parties.

[212:9] But you are above fear, flattery, and every ignoble sentiment, and so naturally look at truth with an unprejudiced eye.

[212:10] And I see that you are deeply interested in the affairs of the Churches, about which you have sent me a letter, as you have said in your last.

[212:11] I should like to know who took charge of the conveyance of this earlier epistle, that I may know who has wronged me by its loss.

[212:12] No letter from you on this subject has yet reached me.

[212:13] 2.

[212:14] How much, then, would I not have given to meet you, that I might tell you all my troubles? When one is in pain it is, as you know, some alleviation, even to describe it.

[212:15] How gladly would I have answered your questions, not trusting to lifeless letters, but in my own person, narrating each particular.

[212:16] The persuasive force of living words is more efficient and they are not so susceptible as letters to attack and to misrepresentation.

[212:17] For now no one has left anything untried, and the very men in whom I put the greatest confidence, men, who when I saw them among others, I used to think something more than human, have received documents written by some one, and have sent them on, whatever they are, as mine, and on their account are calumniating me to the brethren as though there is nothing now that pious and faithful men ought to hold in greater abhorrence than my name.

[212:18] From the beginning it has been my object to live unknown, to a degree not reached by anyone who has considered human infirmity; but now, just as though on the other hand it had been my purpose to make myself notorious to the world, I have been talked about all over the earth, and I may add all over the sea too.

[212:19] For men, who go to the last limit of impiety, and are introducing into the Churches the godless opinion of Unlikeness, are waging war against me.

[212:20] Those too who hold the via media, as they think, and, though they start from the same principles, do not follow out their logical consequences, because they are so opposed to the view of the majority, are equally hostile to me, overwhelming me to the utmost of their ability with their reproaches, and abstaining from no insidious attacks against me.

[212:21] But the Lord has made their endeavours vain.

[212:22] Is not this a grievous state of things? Must it not make my life painful? I have at all events one consolation in my troubles, my bodily infirmity.

[212:23] This I am sure will not suffer me to remain much longer in this miserable life.

[212:24] No more on this point.

[212:25] You too I exhort, in your bodily infirmity, to bear yourself bravely and worthy of the God Who has called us.

[212:26] If He sees us accepting our present circumstances with thanksgiving, He will either put away our troubles as He did Job's, or will requite us with the glorious crowns of patience in the life to come.

[213:1] Letter CCXIII.

[213:2] Without address.

[213:3] 1.

[213:4] May the Lord, Who has brought me prompt help in my afflictions, grant you the help of the refreshment wherewith you have refreshed me by writing to me, rewarding you for your consolation of my humble self with the real and great gladness of the Spirit.

[213:5] For I was indeed downcast in soul when I saw in a great multitude the almost brutish and unreasonable insensibility of the people, and the inveterate and ineradicable unsatisfactoriness of their leaders.

[213:6] But I saw your letter; I saw the treasure of love which it contained; then I knew that He Who ordains all our lives had made some sweet consolation shine on me in the bitterness of my life.

[213:7] I therefore salute your holiness in return, and exhort you, as is my wont, not to cease to pray for my unhappy life, that I may never, drowned in the unrealities of this world, forget God, "who raiseth up the poor out of the dust;" that I may never be lifted up with pride and fall into the condemnation of the devil; that I may never be found by the Lord neglectful of my stewardship and asleep; never discharging it amiss, and wounding the conscience of my fellow-servants; and, never companying with the drunken, suffer the pains threatened in God's just judgment against wicked stewards.

[213:8] I beseech you, therefore, in all your prayers to pray God that I may be watchful in all things; that I may be no shame or disgrace to the name of Christ, in the revelation of the secrets of my heart, in the great day of the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ.

[213:9] 2.

[213:10] Know then that I am expecting to be summoned by the wickedness of the heretics to the court, in the name of peace.

[213:11] Learn too that on being so informed, this bishop wrote to me to hasten to Mesopotamia, and, after assembling together those who in that country are of like sentiments with us, and are strengthening the state of the Church, to travel in their company to the emperor.

[213:12] But perhaps my health will not be good enough to allow me to undertake a journey in the winter.

[213:13] Indeed, hitherto I have not thought the matter pressing, unless you advise it.

[213:14] I shall therefore await your counsel that my mind may be made up.

[213:15] Lose no time then, I beg you, in making known to me, by means of one of our trusty brethren, what course seems best to the divinely guided intelligence of your excellency.

[214:1] Letter CCXIV.

[214:2] To Count Terentius.

[214:3] 1.

[214:4] When I heard that your excellency had again been compelled to take part in public affairs, I was straightway distressed (for the truth must be told) at the thought of how contrary to your mind it must be that you after once giving up the anxieties of official life, and allowing yourself leisure for the care of your soul, should again be forced back into your old career.

[214:5] But then I bethought me that peradventure the Lord has ordained that your lordship should again appear in public from this wish to grant the boon of one alleviation for the countless pains which now beset the Church in our part of the world.

[214:6] I am, moreover, cheered by the thought that I am about to meet your excellency once again before I depart this life.

[214:7] 2.

[214:8] But a further rumour has reached me that you are in Antioch, and are transacting the business in hand with the chief authorities.

[214:9] And, besides this, I have heard that the brethren who are of the party of Paulinus are entering on some discussion with your excellency on the subject of union with us; and by "us" I mean those who are supporters of the blessed man of God, Meletius.

[214:10] I hear, moreover, that the Paulinians are carrying about a letter of the Westerns, assigning to them the episcopate of the Church in Antioch, but speaking under a false impression of Meletius, the admirable bishop of the true Church of God.

[214:11] I am not astonished at this.

[214:12] They are totally ignorant of what is going on here; the others, though they might be supposed to know, give an account to them in which party is put before truth; and it is only what one might expect that they should either be ignorant of the truth, or should even endeavour to conceal the reasons which led the blessed Bishop Athanasius to write to Paulinus.

[214:13] But your excellency has on the spot those who are able to tell you accurately what passed between the bishops in the reign of Jovian, and from them I beseech you to get information.

[214:14] I accuse no one; I pray that I may have love to all, and "especially unto them who are of the household of faith;" and therefore I congratulate those who have received the letter from Rome.

[214:15] And, although it is a grand testimony in their favour, I only hope it is true and confirmed by facts.

[214:16] But I shall never be able to persuade myself on these grounds to ignore Meletius, or to forget the Church which is under him, or to treat as small, and of little importance to the true religion, the questions which originated the division.

[214:17] I shall never consent to give in, merely because somebody is very much elated at receiving a letter from men.

[214:18] Even if it had come down from heaven itself, but he does not agree with the sound doctrine of the faith, I cannot look upon him as in communion with the saints.

[214:19] 3.

[214:20] Consider well, my excellent friend, that the falsifiers of the truth, who have introduced the Arian schism as an innovation on the sound faith of the Fathers, advance no other reason for refusing to accept the pious opinion of the Fathers than the meaning of the homoousion which they hold in their wickedness, and to the slander of the whole faith, alleging our contention to be that the Son is consubstantial in hypostasis.

[214:21] If we give them any opportunity by our being carried away by men who propound these sentiments and their like, rather from simplicity than from malevolence, there is nothing to prevent our giving them an unanswerable ground of argument against ourselves and confirming the heresy of those whose one end is in all their utterances about the Church, not so much to establish their own position as to calumniate mine.

[214:22] What more serious calumny could there be? What better calculated to disturb the faith of the majority than that some of us could be shewn to assert that there is one hypostasis of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? We distinctly lay down that there is a difference of Persons; but this statement was anticipated by Sabellius, who affirms that God is one by hypostasis, but is described by Scripture in different Persons, according to the requirements of each individual case; sometimes under the name of Father, when there is occasion for this Person; sometimes under the name of Son when there is a descent to human interests or any of the operations of the oeconomy; and sometimes under the Person of Spirit when the occasion demands such phraseology.

[214:23] If, then, any among us are shewn to assert that Father, Son and Holy Ghost are one in substance, while we maintain the three perfect Persons, how shall we escape giving clear and incontrovertible proof of the truth of what is being asserted about us?  4.

[214:24] The non-identity of hypostasis and ousia is, I take it, suggested even by our western brethren, where, from a suspicion of the inadequacy of their own language, they have given the word ousia in the Greek, to the end that any possible difference of meaning might be preserved in the clear and unconfounded distinction of terms.

[214:25] If you ask me to state shortly my own view, I shall state that ousia has the same relation to hypostasis as the common has to the particular.

[214:26] Every one of us both shares in existence by the common term of essence (ousia) and by his own properties is such an one and such an one.

[214:27] In the same manner, in the matter in question, the term ousia is common, like goodness, or Godhead, or any similar attribute; while hypostasis is contemplated in the special property of Fatherhood, Sonship, or the power to sanctify.

[214:28] If then they describe the Persons as being without hypostasis, the statement is per se absurd; but if they concede that the Persons exist in real hypostasis, as they acknowledge, let them so reckon them that the principle of the homoousion may be preserved in the unity of the Godhead, and that the doctrine preached may be the recognition of true religion, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the perfect and complete hypostasis of each of the Persons named.

[214:29] Nevertheless, there is one point which I should like to have pressed on your excellency, that you and all who like you care for the truth, and honour the combatant in the cause of true religion, ought to wait for the lead to be taken in bringing about this union and peace by the foremost authorities in the Church, whom I count as pillars and foundations of the truth and of the Church, and reverence all the more because they have been sent away for punishment, and have been exiled far from home.

[214:30] Keep yourself, I implore you, clear of prejudice, that in you, whom God has given me as a staff and support in all things, I may be able to find rest.

[215:1] Letter CCXV.

[215:2] To the Presbyter Dorotheus.

[215:3] I took the earliest opportunity of writing to the most admirable Count Terentius, thinking it better to write to him on the subject in hand by means of strangers, and being anxious that our very dear brother Acacius shall not be inconvenienced by any delay.

[215:4] I have therefore given my letter to the government treasurer, who is travelling by the imperial post, and I have charged him to shew the letter to you first.

[215:5] I cannot understand how it is that no one has told you that the road to Rome is wholly impracticable in winter, the country between Constantinople and our own regions being full of enemies.

[215:6] If the route by sea must be taken, the season will be favourable; if indeed my God-beloved brother Gregory consents to the voyage and to the commission concerning these matters.

[215:7] For my own part, I do not know who can go with him, and am aware that he is quite inexperienced in ecclesiastical affairs.

[215:8] With a man of kindly character he may get on very well, and be treated with respect, but what possible good could accrue to the cause by communication between a man proud and exalted, and therefore quite unable to hear those who preach the truth to him from a lower standpoint, and a man like my brother, to whom anything like mean servility is unknown?.

[216:1] Letter CCXVI.

[216:2] To Meletius, bishop of Antioch.

[216:3] Many other journeys have taken me from home.

[216:4] I have been as far as Pisidia to settle the matters concerning the brethren in Isauria in concert with the Pisidian bishops.

[216:5] Thence I journeyed into Pontus, for Eustathius had caused no small disturbance at Dazimon, and had caused there a considerable secession from our church.

[216:6] I even went as far as the home of my brother Peter, and, as this is not far from Neocaesarea, there was occasion of considerable trouble to the Neocaesareans, and of much rudeness to myself.

[216:7] Some men fled when no one was in pursuit.

[216:8] And I was supposed to be intruding uninvited, simply to get compliments from the folk there.

[216:9] As soon as I got home, after contracting a severe illness from the bad weather and my anxieties, I straightway received a letter from the East to tell me that Paulinus had had certain letters from the West addressed to him, in acknowledgement of a sort of higher claim; and that the Antiochene rebels were vastly elated by them, and were next preparing a form of creed, and offering to make its terms a condition of union with our Church.

[216:10] Besides all this it was reported to me that they had seduced to their faction that most excellent man Terentius.

[216:11] I wrote to him at once as forcibly as I could, to induce him to pause; and I tried to point out their disingenuousness.

[217:1] Letter CCXVII.

[217:2] To Amphilochius, the Canons.

[217:3] On my return from a long journey (for I have been into Pontus on ecclesiastical business, and to visit my relations) with my body weak and ill, and my spirits considerably broken, I took your reverence's letter into my hand.

[217:4] No sooner did I receive the tokens of that voice which to me is of all voices the sweetest, and of that hand that I love so well, than I forgot all my troubles.

[217:5] And if I was made so much more cheerful by the receipt of your letter, you ought to be able to conjecture at what value I price your actual presence.

[217:6] May this be granted me by the Holy One, whenever it may be convenient to you and you yourself send me an invitation.

[217:7] And if you were to come to the house at Euphemias it would indeed be pleasant for me to meet you, escaping from my vexations here, and hastening to your unfeigned affection.

[217:8] Possibly also for other reasons I may be compelled to go as far as Nazianzus by the sudden departure of the very God-beloved bishop Gregory.

[217:9] How or why this has come to pass, so far I have no information.

[217:10] The man about whom I had spoken to your excellency, and whom you expected to be ready by this time, has, you must know, fallen ill of a lingering disease, and is moreover now suffering from an affection of the eyes, arising from his old complaint and from the illness which has now befallen him, and he is quite unfit to do any work.

[217:11] I have no one else with me.

[217:12] It is consequently better, although the matter was left by them to me, for some one to be put forward by them.

[217:13] And indeed one cannot but think that the expressions were used merely as a necessary form, and that what they really wished was what they originally requested, that the person selected for the leadership should be one of themselves.

[217:14] If there is any one of the lately baptized, whether Macedonius approve or not, let him be appointed.

[217:15] You will instruct him in his duties, the Lord, Who in all things cooperates with you, granting you His grace for this work also.

[217:16] LI.

[217:17] As to the clergy, the Canons have enjoined without making any distinction that one penalty is assigned for the lapsed,—ejection from the ministry, whether they be in orders or remain in the ministry which is conferred without imposition of hands.

[217:18] LII.

[217:19] The woman who has given birth to a child and abandoned it in the road, if she was able to save it and neglected it, or thought by this means to hide her sin, or was moved by some brutal and inhuman motive, is to be judged as in a case of murder.

[217:20] If, on the other hand, she was unable to provide for it.

[217:21] and the child perish from exposure and want of the necessities of life, the mother is to be pardoned.

[217:22] LIII.

[217:23] The widowed slave is not guilty of a serious fall if she adopts a second marriage under colour of rape.

[217:24] She is not on this ground open to accusation.

[217:25] It is rather the object than the pretext which must be taken into account, but it is clear that she is exposed to the punishment of digamy.

[217:26] LIV.

[217:27] I know that I have already written to your reverence, so far as I can, on the distinctions to be observed in cases of involuntary homicide, and on this point I can say no more.

[217:28] It rests with your intelligence to increase or lessen the severity of the punishment as each individual case may require.

[217:29] LV.

[217:30] Assailants of robbers, if they are outside, are prohibited from the communion of the good thing.

[217:31] If they are clerics they are degraded from their orders.

[217:32] For, it is said, "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword".

[217:33] LVI.

[217:34] The intentional homicide, who has afterwards repented, will be excommunicated from the sacrament for twenty years.

[217:35] The twenty years will be appointed for him as follows: for four he ought to weep, standing outside the door of the house of prayer, beseeching the faithful as they enter in to offer prayer in his behalf, and confessing his own sin.

[217:36] After four years he will be admitted among the hearers, and during five years will go out with them.

[217:37] During seven years he will go out with the kneelers, praying.

[217:38] During four years he will only stand with the faithful, and will not take part in the oblation.

[217:39] On the completion of this period he will be admitted to participation of the sacrament.

[217:40] LVII.

[217:41] The unintentional homicide will be excluded for ten years from the sacrament.

[217:42] The ten years will be arranged as follows: For two years he will weep, for three years he will continue among the hearers; for four he will be a kneeler; and for one he will only stand.

[217:43] Then he will be admitted to the holy rites.

[217:44] LVIII.

[217:45] The adulterer will be excluded from the sacrament for fifteen years.

[217:46] During four he will be a weeper, and during five a hearer, during four a kneeler, and for two a slander without communion.

[217:47] LIX.

[217:48] The fornicator will not be admitted to participation in the sacrament for seven years; weeping two, hearing two, kneeling two, and standing one: in the eighth he will be received into communion.

[217:49] LX.

[217:50] The woman who has professed virginity and broken her promise will complete the time appointed in the case of adultery in her continence.

[217:51] The same rule will be observed in the case of men who have professed a solitary life and who lapse.

[217:52] LXI.

[217:53] The thief, if he have repented of his own accord and charged himself, shall only be prohibited from partaking of the sacrament for a year; if he be convicted, for two years.

[217:54] The period shall be divided between kneeling and standing.

[217:55] Then let him be held worthy of communion.

[217:56] LXII.

[217:57] He who is guilty of unseemliness with males will be under discipline for the same time as adulterers.

[217:58] LXIII.

[217:59] He who confesses his iniquity in the case of brutes shall observe the same time in penance.

[217:60] LXIV.

[217:61] Perjurers shall be excommunicated for ten years; weeping for two, hearing for three, kneeling for four, and standing only during one year; then they shall be held worthy of communion.

[217:62] LXV.

[217:63] He who confesses magic or sorcery shall do penance for the time of murder, and shall be treated in the same manner as he who convicts himself of this sin.

[217:64] LXVI.

[217:65] The tomb breaker shall be excommunicated for ten years, weeping for two, hearing for three, kneeling for four, standing for one, then he shall be admitted.

[217:66] LXVII.

[217:67] Incest with a sister shall incur penance for the same time as murder.

[217:68] LXVIII.

[217:69] The union of kindred within the prohibited degrees of marriage, if detected as having taken place in acts of sin, shall receive the punishment of adultery.

[217:70] LXIX.

[217:71] The Reader who has intercourse with his betrothed before marriage, shall be allowed to read after a year's suspension, remaining without advancement.

[217:72] If he has had secret intercourse without betrothal, he shall be deposed from his ministry.

[217:73] So too the minister.

[217:74] LXX.

[217:75] The deacon who has been polluted in lips, and has confessed his commission of this sin, shall be removed from his ministry.

[217:76] But he shall be permitted to partake of the sacrament together with the deacons.

[217:77] The same holds good in the case of a priest.

[217:78] If any one be detected in a more serious sin, whatever be his degree, he shall be deposed.

[217:79] LXXI.

[217:80] Whoever is aware of the commission of any one of the aforementioned sins, and is convicted without having confessed, shall be under punishment for the same space of time as the actual perpetrator.

[217:81] LXXII.

[217:82] He who has entrusted himself to soothsayers, or any such persons, shall be under discipline for the same time as the homicide.

[217:83] LXXIII.

[217:84] He who has denied Christ, and sinned against the mystery of salvation, ought to weep all his life long, and is bound to remain in penitence, being deemed worthy of the sacrament in the hour of death, through faith in the mercy of God.

[217:85] LXXIV.

[217:86] If, however, each man who has committed the former sins is made good, through penitence, he to whom is committed by the loving-kindness of God the power of loosing and binding will not be deserving of condemnation, if he become less severe, as he beholds the exceeding greatness of the penitence of the sinner, so as to lessen the period of punishment, for the history in the Scriptures informs us that all who exercise penitence with greater zeal quickly receive the loving-kindness of God.

[217:87] LXXV.

[217:88] The man who has been polluted with his own sister, either on the father's or the mother's side, must not be allowed to enter the house of prayer, until he has given up his iniquitous and unlawful conduct.

[217:89] And, after he has come to a sense of that fearful sin, let him weep for three years standing at the door of the house of prayer, and entreating the people as they go in to prayer that each and all will mercifully offer on his behalf their prayers with earnestness to the Lord.

[217:90] After this let him be received for another period of three years to hearing alone, and while hearing the Scriptures and the instruction, let him be expelled and not be admitted to prayer.

[217:91] Afterwards, if he has asked it with tears and has fallen before the Lord with contrition of heart and great humiliation, let kneeling be accorded to him during other three years.

[217:92] Thus, when he shall have worthily shown the fruits of repentance, let him be received in the tenth year to the prayer of the faithful without oblation; and after standing with the faithful in prayer for two years, then, and not till then, let him be held worthy of the communion of the good thing.

[217:93] LXXVI.

[217:94] The same rule applies to those who take their own daughters in law.

[217:95] LXXVII.

[217:96] He who abandons the wife, lawfully united to him, is subject by the sentence of the Lord to the penalty of adultery.

[217:97] But it has been laid down as a canon by our Fathers that such sinners should weep for a year, be hearers for two years, in kneeling for three years, stand with the faithful in the seventh; and thus be deemed worthy of the oblation, if they have repented with tears.

[217:98] LXXVIII.

[217:99] Let the same rule hold good in the case of those who marry two sisters, although at different times.

[217:100] LXXIX.

[217:101] Men who rage after their stepmothers are subject to the same canon as those who rage after their sisters.

[217:102] LXXX.

[217:103] On polygamy the Fathers are silent, as being brutish and altogether inhuman.

[217:104] The sin seems to me worse than fornication.

[217:105] It is therefore reasonable that such sinners should be subject to the canons; namely a year's weeping, three years kneeling and then reception.

[217:106] LXXXI.

[217:107] During the invasion of the barbarians many men have sworn heathen oaths, tasted things unlawfully offered them in magic temples and so have broken their faith in God.

[217:108] Let regulations be made in the case of these men in accordance with the canons laid down by our Fathers.

[217:109] Those who have endured grievous tortures and have been forced to denial, through inability to sustain the anguish, may be excluded for three years, hearers for two, kneelers for three, and so be received into communion.

[217:110] Those who have abandoned their faith in God, laying hands on the tables of the demons and swearing heathen oaths, without under going great violence, should be excluded for three years, hearers for two.

[217:111] When they have prayed for three years as kneelers, and have stood other three with the faithful in supplication, then let them be received into the communion of the good thing.

[217:112] LXXXII.

[217:113] As to perjurers, if they have broken their oaths under violent compulsion, they are under lighter penalties and may therefore be received after six years.

[217:114] If they break their faith without compulsion, let them be weepers for two years, hearers for three, pray as kneelers for five, during two be received into the communion of prayer, without oblation, and so at last, after giving proof of due repentance, they shall be restored to the communion of the body of Christ.

[217:115] LXXXIII.

[217:116] Consulters of soothsayers and they who follow heathen customs, or bring persons into their houses to discover remedies and to effect purification, should fall under the canon of six years.

[217:117] After weeping a year, hearing a year, kneeling for three years and standing with the faithful for a year so let them be received.

[217:118] LXXXIV.

[217:119] I write all this with a view to testing the fruits of repentance.

[217:120] I do not decide such matters absolutely by time, but I give heed to the manner of penance.

[217:121] If men are in a state in which they find it hard to be weaned from their own ways and choose rather to serve the pleasures of the flesh than to serve the Lord, and refuse to accept the Gospel life, there is no common ground between me and them.

[217:122] In the midst of a disobedient and gainsaying people I have been taught to hear the words "Save thy own soul".

[217:123] Do not then let us consent to perish together with such sinners.

[217:124] Let us fear the awful judgment.

[217:125] Let us keep before our eyes the terrible day of the retribution of the Lord.

[217:126] Let us not consent to perish in other men's sins, for if the terrors of the Lord have not taught us, if so great calamities have not brought us to feel that it is because of our iniquity that the Lord has abandoned us, and given us into the hands of barbarians, that the people have been led captive before our foes and given over to dispersion, because the bearers of Christ's name have dared such deeds; if they have not known nor understood that it is for these reasons that the wrath of God has come upon us, what common ground of argument have I with them?  But we ought to testify to them day and night, alike in public and in private.

[217:127] Let us not consent to be drawn away with them in their wickedness.

[217:128] Let us above all pray that we may do them good, and rescue them from the snare of the evil one.

[217:129] If we cannot do this, let us at all events do our best to save our own souls from everlasting damnation.

[218:1] Letter CCXVIII.

[218:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[218:3] Brother aelianus has himself completed the business concerning which he came, and has stood in need of no aid from me.

[218:4] I owe him, however, double thanks, both for bringing me a letter from your reverence and for affording me an opportunity of writing to you.

[218:5] By him, therefore, I salute your true and unfeigned love, and beseech you to pray for me more than ever now, when I stand in such need of the aid of your prayers.

[218:6] My health has suffered terribly from the journey to Pontus and my sickness is unendurable.

[218:7] One thing I have long been anxious to make known to you.

[218:8] I do not mean to say that I have been so affected by any other cause as to forget it, but now I wish to put you in mind to send some good man into Lycia, to enquire who are of the right faith, for peradventure they ought not to be neglected, if indeed the report is true, which has been brought to me by a pious traveller from thence, that they have become altogether alienated from the opinion of the Asiani and wish to embrace communion with us.

[218:9] If any one is to go let him enquire at Corydala for Alexander, the late monk, the bishop; at Limyra for Diotimus, and at Myra for Tatianus, Polemo, and Macarius presbyters; at Patara for Eudemus, the bishop; at Telmessus for Hilarius, the bishop; at Phelus for Lallianus, the bishop.

[218:10] Of these and of more besides I have been informed that they are sound in the faith, and I have been grateful to God that even any in the Asian region should be clear of the heretic's pest.

[218:11] If, then, it be possible, let us in the meanwhile make personal enquiry about them.

[218:12] When we have obtained information I am for writing a letter, and am anxious to invite one of them to meet me.

[218:13] God grant that all may go well with that Church at Iconium, which is so dear to me.

[218:14] Through you I salute all the honourable clergy and all who are associated with your reverence.

[219:1] Letter CCXIX.

[219:2] To the clergy of Samosata.

[219:3] The Lord ordereth "all things in measure and weight," and brings on us the temptations which do not exceed our power to endure them, but tests all that fight in the cause of true religion by affliction, not suffering them to be tempted above that they are able to bear.

[219:4] He gives tears to drink in great measure to all who ought to show whether in their affections they are preserving their gratitude to Him.

[219:5] Especially in His dispensation concerning you has He shown His loving-kindness, not suffering such a persecution to be brought on you by your enemies as might turn some of you aside, or cause you to swerve from the faith of Christ.

[219:6] He has matched you with adversaries who are of small importance and easy to be repelled, and has prepared the prize for your patience in your victory over them.

[219:7] But the common enemy of our life, who, in his wiles, strives against the goodness of God, because he has seen that, like a strong wall, you are despising attack from without, has devised, as I hear, that there should arise among yourselves mutual offences and quarrels.

[219:8] These indeed, at the outset, are insignificant and easy of cure; as time goes on, however, they are increased by contention and are wont to result in irremediable mischief.

[219:9] I have, therefore, undertaken to exhort you by this letter.

[219:10] Had it been possible, I would have come myself and supplicated you in person.

[219:11] But this is prevented by present circumstances, and so, in lieu of supplication, I hold out this letter to you, that you may respect my entreaty, may put a stop to your mutual rivalries, and may soon send me the good news that all cause of offence among you is at an end.

[219:12] 2.

[219:13] I am very anxious that you should know that he is great before God who humbly submits to his neighbour and submits to charges against himself, without having cause for shame, even though they are not true, that he may bring the great blessing of peace upon God's Church.

[219:14] I hope that there will arise among you a friendly rivalry, as to who shall first be worthy of being called God's son, after winning this rank for himself because of his being a peacemaker.

[219:15] A letter has also been written to you by your very God-beloved bishop as to the course which you ought to pursue.

[219:16] He will write again what it belongs to him to say.

[219:17] But I too, because of its having been already allowed me to be near you, cannot disregard your position.

[219:18] So on the arrival of the very devout brother Theodorus the sub-deacon, and his report that your Church is in distress and disturbance, being deeply grieved and much pained at heart, I could not endure to keep silence.

[219:19] I implore you to fling away all controversy with one another, and to make peace, that you may avoid giving pleasure to you opponents and destroying the boast of the Church, which is now noised abroad throughout the world, that you all, as you are ruled by one soul and heart, so live in one body.

[219:20] Through your reverences I salute all the people of God, both those in rank and office and the rest of the clergy.

[219:21] I exhort you to keep your old character.

[219:22] I can ask for nothing more than this because by the exhibition of your good works you have anticipated and made impossible any improvement on them.

[220:1] Letter CCXX.

[220:2] To the Beraeans.

[220:3] The Lord has given great consolation to all who are deprived of personal intercourse in allowing them to communicate by letter.

[220:4] By this means, it is true, we cannot learn the express image of the body, but we can learn the disposition of the very soul.

[220:5] Thus on the present occasion, when I had received the letter of your reverences, I at the same moment recognised you, and took your love towards me into my heart, and needed no long time to create intimacy with you.

[220:6] The disposition shewn in your letter was quite enough to enkindle in me affection for the beauty of your soul.

[220:7] And, besides your letter, excellent as it was, I had a yet plainer proof of how things are with you from the amiability of the brethren who have been the means of communication between us.

[220:8] The well-beloved and reverend presbyter Acacius, has told me much in addition to what you have written, and has brought before my eyes the conflict you have to keep up day by day, and the stoutness of the stand you are making for the true religion.

[220:9] He has thus so moved my admiration, and roused in me so earnest a desire of enjoying the good qualities in you, that I do pray the Lord that a time may come when I may know you and yours by personal experience.

[220:10] He has told me of the exactitude of those of you who are entrusted with the ministry of the altar, and moreover of the harmonious agreement of all the people, and the generous character and genuine love towards God of the magistrates and chief men of your city.

[220:11] I consequently congratulate the Church on consisting of such members, and pray that spiritual peace may be given to you in yet greater abundance, to the end that in quieter times you may derive enjoyment from your labours in the day of affliction.

[220:12] For sufferings that are painful while they are being experienced are naturally often remembered with pleasure.

[220:13] For the present I beseech you not to faint.

[220:14] Do not despair because your troubles follow so closely one upon another.

[220:15] Your crowns are near: the help of the Lord is near.

[220:16] Do not let all you have hitherto undergone go for nothing; do not nullify a struggle which has been famous over all the world.

[220:17] Human life is but of brief duration.

[220:18] "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.

[220:19] …The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand for ever".

[220:20] Let us hold fast to the commandment that abideth, and despise the unreality that passeth away.

[220:21] Many Churches have been cheered by your example.

[220:22] In calling new champions into the field you have won for yourselves a great reward, though you knew it not.

[220:23] The Giver of the prize is rich, and is able to reward you not unworthily for your brave deeds.

[221:1] Letter CCXXI.

[221:2] To the Beraeans.

[221:3] You were previously known to me, my dear friends, by your far-famed piety, and by the crown won by your confession in Christ.

[221:4] Peradventure one of you may ask in reply who can have carried these tidings of us so far? The Lord Himself; for He puts His worshippers like a lamp on a lamp-stand, and makes them shine throughout the whole world.

[221:5] Are not winners in the games wont to be made famous by the prize of victory, and craftsmen by the skilful design of their work? Shall the memory of these and others like them abide for ever unforgotten, and shall not Christ's worshippers concerning whom the Lord says Himself, Them that honour me I will honour, be made famous and glorious by Him before all? Shall He not display the brightness of their radiant splendour as He does the beams of the sun? But I have been moved to greater longing for you by the letter which you have been good enough to send me, a letter in which, above and beyond your former efforts on behalf of the truth, you have been yet more lavish of your abounding and vigorous zeal for the true faith.

[221:6] In all this I rejoice with you, and I pray with you that the God of the universe, Whose is the struggle and the arena, and Who gives the crown, may fill you with enthusiasm, may make your souls strong, and make your work such as to meet with His divine approval.

[222:1] Letter CCXXII.

[222:2] To the people of Chalcis.

[222:3] The letter of your reverences came upon me in an hour of affliction like water poured into the mouths of racehorses, inhaling dust with each eager breath at high noontide in the middle of the course.

[222:4] Beset by trial after trial, I breathed again, at once cheered by your words and invigorated by the thought of your struggles to meet that which is before me with unflinching courage.

[222:5] For the conflagration which has devoured a great part of the East is already advancing by slow degrees into our own neighbourhood, and after burning everything round about us is trying to reach even the Churches in Cappadocia, already moved to tears by the smoke that rises from the ruins of our neighbours' homes.

[222:6] The flames have almost reached me.

[222:7] May the Lord divert them by the breath of His mouth, and stay this wicked fire.

[222:8] Who is such a coward, so unmanly, so untried in the athlete's struggles, as not to be nerved to the fight by your cheers, and pray to be hailed victor at your side? You have been the first to step into the arena of true religion; you have beaten off many an attack in bouts with the heretics; you have borne the strong hot wind of trial, both you who are leaders of the Church, to whom has been the ministry of the altar, and every individual of the laity, including those of higher rank.

[222:9] For this in you is specially admirable and worthy of all praise, that you are all one in the Lord, some of you leaders in the march to what is good, others willingly following.

[222:10] It is for this reason that you are too strong for the attack of your assailants, and allow no hold to your antagonists in any one of your members, wherefore day and night I pray the King of the ages to preserve the people in the integrity of their faith, and for them to preserve the clergy, like a head unharmed at the top, exercising its own watchful forethought for every portion of the body underneath.

[222:11] For while the eyes discharge their functions, the hands can do their work as they ought, the feet can move without tripping, and no part of the body is deprived of due care.

[222:12] I beseech you, then, to cling to one another, as you are doing and as you will do.

[222:13] I beseech you who are entrusted with the care of souls to keep each and all together, and to cherish them like beloved children.

[222:14] I beseech the people to continue to show you the respect and honour due to fathers, that in the goodly order of your Church you may keep your strength and the foundation of your faith in Christ; that God's name may be glorified and the good gift of love increase and abound.

[222:15] May I, as I hear of you, rejoice in your progress in God.

[222:16] If I am still bidden to sojourn in the flesh in this world, may I one day see you in the peace of God.

[222:17] If I be now summoned to depart this life, may I see you in the radiant glory of the saints, together with all them who are accounted worthy through patience and showing forth of good works, with crowns upon your heads.

[223:1] Letter CCXXIII.

[223:2] Against Eustathius of Sebasteia.

[223:3] 1.

[223:4] There is a time to keep silence and a time to speak, is the saying of the Preacher.

[223:5] Time enough has been given to silence, and now the time has come to open my mouth for the publication of the truth concerning matters that are, up to now, unknown.

[223:6] The illustrious Job bore his calamities for a long time in silence, and ever showed his courage by holding out under the most intolerable sufferings, but when he had struggled long enough in silence, and had persisted in covering his anguish in the bottom of his heart, at last he opened his mouth and uttered his well-known words.

[223:7] In my own case this is now the third year of my silence, and my boast has become like that of the Psalmist, "I was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs".

[223:8] Thus I shut up in the bottom of my heart the pangs which I suffered on account of the calumnies directed against me, for calumny humbles a man, and calumny makes a poor man giddy.

[223:9] If, therefore, the mischief of calumny is so great as to cast down even the perfect man from his height, for this is what Scripture indicates by the word man, and by the poor man is meant he who lacks the great doctrines, as is the view also of the prophet when he says, "These are poor, therefore they shall not hear;…I will get me unto the great men," he means by poor those who are lacking in understanding; and here, too, he plainly means those who are not yet furnished in the inner man, and have not even come to the full measure of their age; it is these who are said by the proverb to be made giddy and tossed about.

[223:10] Nevertheless I thought that I ought to bear my troubles in silence, waiting for some indication to come out of them.

[223:11] I did not even think that what was said against me proceeded from ill will; I thought it was the result of ignorance of the truth.

[223:12] But now I see that hostility increases with time, and that my slanderers are not sorry for what they said at the beginning, and do not take any trouble to make amends for the past, but go on and on and rally themselves together to attain their original object.

[223:13] This was to make my life miserable and to devise means for sullying my reputation among the brethren.

[223:14] I, therefore, no longer see safety in silence.

[223:15] I have bethought me of the words of Isaiah: "I have long time holden my peace, shall I always be still and refrain myself? I have been patient like a travailing woman".

[223:16] God grant that I may both receive the reward of silence, and gain some strength to confute my opponents, and that thus, by confuting them, I may dry up the bitter torrent of falsehood that has gushed out against me.

[223:17] So might I say, "My soul has passed over the torrent;" and, "If it had not been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us,…then they had swallowed us up quick, the water had drowned us".

[223:18] 2.

[223:19] Much time had I spent in vanity, and had wasted nearly all my youth in the vain labour which I underwent in acquiring the wisdom made foolish by God.

[223:20] Then once upon a time, like a man roused from deep sleep, I turned my eyes to the marvellous light of the truth of the Gospel, and I perceived the uselessness of "the wisdom of the princes of this world, that come to naught".

[223:21] I wept many tears over my miserable life and I prayed that guidance might be vouchsafed me to admit me to the doctrines of true religion.

[223:22] First of all was I minded to make some mending of my ways, long perverted as they were by my intimacy with wicked men.

[223:23] Then I read the Gospel, and I saw there that a great means of reaching perfection was the selling of one's goods, the sharing them with the poor, the giving up of all care for this life, and the refusal to allow the soul to be turned by any sympathy to things of earth.

[223:24] And I prayed that I might find some one of the brethren who had chosen this way of life, that with him I might cross life's short and troubled strait.

[223:25] And many did I find in Alexandria, and many in the rest of Egypt, and others in Palestine, and in Coele Syria, and in Mesopotamia.

[223:26] I admired their continence in living, and their endurance in toil; I was amazed at their persistency in prayer, and at their triumphing over sleep; subdued by no natural necessity, ever keeping their souls' purpose high and free, in hunger, in thirst, in cold, in nakedness, they never yielded to the body; they were never willing to waste attention on it; always, as though living in a flesh that was not theirs, they shewed in very deed what it is to sojourn for a while in this life, and what to have one's citizenship and home in heaven.

[223:27] All this moved my admiration.

[223:28] I called these men's lives blessed, in that they did in deed shew that they "bear about in their body the dying of Jesus".

[223:29] And I prayed that I, too, as far as in me lay, might imitate them.

[223:30] 3.

[223:31] So when I beheld certain men in my own country striving to copy their ways, I felt that I had found a help to my own salvation, and I took the things seen for proof of things unseen.

[223:32] And since the secrets in the hearts of each of us are unknown, I held lowliness of dress to be a sufficient indication of lowliness of spirit; and there was enough to convince me in the coarse cloak, the girdle, and the shoes of untanned hide.

[223:33] And though many were for withdrawing me from their society, I would not allow it, because I saw that they put a life of endurance before a life of pleasure; and, because of the extraordinary excellence of their lives, I became an eager supporter of them.

[223:34] And so it came about that I would not hear of any fault being found with their doctrines, although many maintained that their conceptions about God were erroneous, and that they had become disciples of the champion of the present heresy, and were secretly propagating his teaching.

[223:35] But, as I had never at any time heard these things with my own ears, I concluded that those who reported them were calumniators.

[223:36] Then I was called to preside over the Church.

[223:37] Of the watchmen and spies, who were given me under the pretence of assistance and loving communion, I say nothing, lest I seem to injure my own cause by telling an incredible tale, or give believers an occasion for hating their fellows, if I am believed.

[223:38] This had almost been my own case, had I not been prevented by the mercy of God.

[223:39] For almost every one became an object of suspicion to me, and smitten at heart as I was by wounds treacherously inflicted, I seemed to find nothing in any man that I could trust.

[223:40] But so far there was, nevertheless, a kind of intimacy kept up between us.

[223:41] Once and again we held discussions on doctrinal points.

[223:42] and apparently we seemed to agree and keep together.

[223:43] But they began to find out that I made the same statements concerning my faith in God which they had always heard from me.

[223:44] For, if other things in me may move a sigh, this one boast at least I dare make in the Lord, that never for one moment have I held erroneous conceptions about God, or entertained heterodox opinions, which I have learnt later to change.

[223:45] The teaching about God which I had received as a boy from my blessed mother and my grandmother Macrina, I have ever held with increased conviction.

[223:46] On my coming to ripe years of reason I did not shift my opinions from one to another, but carried out the principles delivered to me by my parents.

[223:47] Just as the seed when it grows is first tiny and then gets bigger but always preserves its identity, not changed in kind though gradually perfected in growth, so I reckon the same doctrine to have grown in my case through gradually advancing stages.

[223:48] What I hold now has not replaced what I held at the beginning.

[223:49] Let them search their own consciences.

[223:50] Let these men who have now made me the common talk on the charge of false doctrine, and deafened all men's ears with the defamatory letters which they have written against me, so that I am compelled thus to defend myself, ask themselves if they have ever heard anything from me, differing from what I now say, and let them remember the judgment seat of Christ.

[223:51] 4.

[223:52] I am charged with blasphemy against God.

[223:53] Yet it is impossible for me to be convicted on the ground of any treatise concerning the Faith, which they urge against me, nor can I be charged on the ground of the utterances which I have from time to time delivered by word of mouth, without their being committed to writing, in the churches of God.

[223:54] Not a single witness has been found to say that he has ever heard from me, when speaking in private, anything contrary to true religion.

[223:55] If then I am not an unorthodox writer, if no fault can be found with my preaching, if I do not lead astray those who converse with me in my own home, on what ground am I being judged? But there is a new invention! Somebody, runs the charge, in Syria has written something inconsistent with true religion; and twenty years or more ago you wrote him a letter: so you are an accomplice of the fellow, and what is urged against him is urged against you.

[223:56] O truth-loving sir, I reply, you who have been taught that lies are the offspring of the devil; what has proved to you that I wrote that letter? You never sent; you never asked; you were never informed by me, who might have told you the truth.

[223:57] But if the letter was mine, how do you know that the document that has come into your hands now is of the same date as my letter? Who told you that it is twenty years old? How do you know that it is a composition of the man to whom my letter was sent? And if he was the composer, and I wrote to him, and my letter and his composition belong to the same date, what proof is there that I accepted it in my judgment, and that I hold those views?  5.

[223:58] Ask yourself.

[223:59] How often did you visit me in my monastery on the Iris, when my very God-beloved brother Gregory was with me, following the same course of life as myself? Did you ever hear anything of the kind? Was there any appearance of such a thing, small or great? How many days did we spend in the opposite village, at my mother's, living as friend with friend, and discoursing together night and day? Did you ever find me holding any opinion of the kind? And when we went together to visit the blessed Silvanus, did we not talk of these things on the way? And at Eusinoe, when you were about to set out with other bishops for Lampsacus, was not our discourse about the faith? Were not your shorthand writers at my side the whole time while I was dictating my objections to the heresy? Were not your most faithful disciples there too? When I was visiting the brotherhood, and passing the night with them in their prayers, continually speaking and hearing of the things pertaining to God without dispute, was not the evidence which I gave of my sentiments exact and definite? How came you then to reckon this rotten and slender suspicion as of more importance than the experience of such a length of time?  What evidence of my frame of mind ought you to have preferred to your own? Has there been the slightest want of harmony in my utterances about the faith at Chalcedon, again and again at Heraclea, and at an earlier period in the suburb of Caesarea? Are they not all mutually consistent? I only except the increase in force of which I spoke just now, resulting from advance, and which is not to be regarded as a change from worse to better, but rather as a filling up of what was wanting in the addition of knowledge.

[223:60] How can you fail to bear in mind that the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son, nor the son bear the iniquity of the father, but each shall die in his own sin? I have neither father nor son slandered by you; I have had neither teacher nor disciple.

[223:61] But if the sins of the parents must be made charges against their children, it is far fairer for the sins of Arius to be charged against his disciples; and, whoever begat the heretic Aetius, for the charges against the son to be applied to the father.

[223:62] If on the other hand it is unjust for any one to be accused for their sakes, it is far more unjust that I should be held responsible for the sake of men with whom I have nothing to do, even if they were in every respect sinners, and something worthy of condemnation has been written by them.

[223:63] I must be pardoned if I do not believe all that is urged against them.

[223:64] since my own experience shows me how very easy it is for accusers to slip into slander.

[223:65] 6.

[223:66] Even if they did come forward to accuse me, because they had been deceived, and thought that I was associated with the writers of those words of Sabellius which they are carrying about, they were guilty of unpardonable conduct in straightway attacking and wounding me, when I had done them no wrong, before they had obtained plain proof.

[223:67] I do not like to speak of myself as bound to them in the closest intimacy; or of them as being evidently not led by the Holy Spirit, because of their cherishing false suspicions.

[223:68] Much anxious thought must be taken, and many sleepless nights must be passed, and with many tears must the truth be sought from God, by him who is on the point of cutting himself off from a brother's friendship.

[223:69] Even the rulers of this world, when they are on the point of sentencing some evil doer to death, draw the veil aside, and call in experts for the examination of the case, and consume considerable time in weighing the severity of the law against the common fault of humanity, and with many a sigh and many a lament for the stern necessity of the case, proclaim before all the people that they are obeying the law from necessity, and not passing sentence to gratify their own wishes.

[223:70] How much greater care and diligence, how much more counsel, ought to be taken by one who is on the point of breaking off from long established friendship with a brother! In this case there is only a single letter and that of doubtful genuineness.

[223:71] It would be quite impossible to argue that it is known by the signature, for they possess not the original, but only a copy.

[223:72] They depend on one single document and that an old one.

[223:73] It is now twenty years since anything has been written to that person.

[223:74] Of my opinions and conduct in the intervening time I can adduce no better witnesses than the very men who attack and accuse me.

[223:75] 7.

[223:76] But the real reason of separation is not this letter.

[223:77] There is another cause of alienation.

[223:78] I am ashamed to mention it; and I would have been for ever silent about it had not recent events compelled me to publish all their mind for the sake of the good of the mass of the people.

[223:79] Good men have thought that communion with me was a bar to the recovery of their authority.

[223:80] Some have been influenced by the signature of a certain creed which I proposed to them, not that I distrusted their sentiments, I confess, but because I wished to do away with the suspicions which the more part of the brethren who agree with me entertained of them.

[223:81] Accordingly, to avoid anything arising from that confession to prevent their being accepted by the present authorities, they have renounced communion with me.

[223:82] This letter was devised by an after-thought as a pretext for the separation.

[223:83] A very plain proof of what I say is, that after they had denounced me, and composed such complaints against me as suited them, they sent round their letters in all directions before communicating with me.

[223:84] Their letter was in the possession of others who had received it in the course of transmission and who were on the point of sending it on seven days before it had reached my hands.

[223:85] The idea was that it would be handed from one to another and so would be quickly distributed over the whole country.

[223:86] This was reported to me at the time by those who were giving me clear information of all their proceedings.

[223:87] But I determined to hold my tongue until the Revealer of all secrets should publish their doings by plain and incontrovertible demonstration.

[224:1] Letter CCXXIV.

[224:2] To the presbyter Genethlius.

[224:3] 1.

[224:4] I have received your reverence's letter and I am delighted at the title which you have felicitously applied to the writing which they have composed in calling it "a writing of divorcement".

[224:5] What defence the writers will be able to make before the tribunal of Christ, where no excuse will avail, I am quite unable to conceive.

[224:6] After accusing me, violently running me down, and telling tales in accordance not with the truth but with what they wished to be true, they have assumed a great show of humility, and have accused me of haughtiness for refusing to receive their envoys.

[224:7] They have written, as they have, what is all—or nearly all—for I do not wish to exaggerate,—lies, in the endeavour to persuade men rather than God, and to please men rather than God, with Whom nothing is more precious than truth.

[224:8] Moreover into the letter written against me they have introduced heretical expressions, and have concealed the author of the impiety, in order that most of the more unsophisticated might be deceived by the calumny got up against me, and suppose the portion introduced to be mine.

[224:9] For nothing is said by my ingenious slanderers as to the name of the author of these vile doctrines, and it is left for the simple to suspect that these inventions, if not their expression in writing, is due to me.

[224:10] Now that you know all this, I exhort you not to be perturbed yourselves, and to calm the excitement of those who are agitated.

[224:11] I say this although I know that it will not be easy for my defence to be received, because I have been anticipated by the vile calumnies uttered against me by persons of influence.

[224:12] 2.

[224:13] Now as to the point that the writings going the round as mine are not mine at all, the angry feeling felt against me so confuses their reason that they cannot see what is profitable.

[224:14] Nevertheless, if the question were put to them by yourselves, I do think that they would not reach such a pitch of obstinate perversity as to dare to utter the lie with their own lips, and allege the document in question to be mine.

[224:15] And if it is not mine, why am I being judged for other men's writings? But they will urge that I am in communion with Apollinarius, and cherish in my heart perverse doctrines of this kind.

[224:16] Let them be asked for proof.

[224:17] If they are able to search into a man's heart, let them say so; and do you admit the truth of all that they say about everything.

[224:18] If on the other hand, they are trying to prove my being in communion on plain and open grounds, let them produce either a canonical letter written by me to him, or by him to me.

[224:19] Let them shew that I have held intercourse with his clergy, or have ever received any one of them into the communion of prayer.

[224:20] If they adduce the letter written now five and twenty years ago, written by layman to layman, and not even this as I wrote it, but altered (God knows by whom), then recognise their unfairness.

[224:21] No bishop is accused if, while he was a layman, he wrote something somewhat incautiously on an indifferent matter; not anything concerning the Faith, but a mere word of friendly greeting.

[224:22] Possibly even my opponents are known to have written to Jews and to Pagans, without incurring any blame.

[224:23] Hitherto no one has ever been judged for any such conduct as that on which I am being condemned by these strainers-out of gnats.

[224:24] God, who knows men's hearts, knows that I never wrote these things, nor sanctioned them, but that I anathematize all who hold the vile opinion of the confusion of the hypostases, on which point the most impious heresy of Sabellius has been revived.

[224:25] And all the brethren who have been personally acquainted with my insignificant self know it equally well.

[224:26] Let those very men who now vehemently accuse me, search their own consciences, and they will own that from my boyhood I have been far removed from any doctrine of the kind.

[224:27] 3.

[224:28] If any one enquires what my opinion is, he will learn it from the actual little document, to which is appended their own autograph signature.

[224:29] This they wish to destroy, and they are anxious to conceal their own change of position in slandering me.

[224:30] For they do not like to own that they have repented of their subscription to the tract I gave them; while they charge me with impiety from the idea that no one perceives that their disruption from me is only a pretext, while in reality they have departed from that faith which they have over and over again owned in writing, before many witnesses, and have lastly received and subscribed when delivered to them by me.

[224:31] It is open to any one to read the signatures and to learn the truth from the document itself.

[224:32] Their intention will be obvious, if, after reading the subscription which they gave me, any one reads the creed which they gave Gelasius, and observes what a vast difference there is between the two confessions.

[224:33] It would be better for men who so easily shift their own position, not to examine other men's motes but to cast out the beam in their own eye.

[224:34] I am making a more complete defence on every point in another letter; this will satisfy readers who want fuller assurance.

[224:35] Do you, now that you have received this letter, put away all despondency, and confirm the love to me, which makes me eagerly long for union with you.

[224:36] Verily it is a great sorrow to me, and a pain in my heart that cannot be assuaged, if the slanders uttered against me so far prevail as to chill your love and to alienate us from one another.

[224:37] Farewell.

[225:1] Letter CCXXV.

[225:2] To Demosthenes, as from the synod of bishops.

[225:3] I am always very thankful to God and to the emperor, under whose rule we live, when I see the government of my country put into the hands of one who is not only a Christian, but is moreover correct in life and a careful guardian of the laws according to which our life in this world is ordered.

[225:4] I have had special reason for offering this gratitude to God and to our God-beloved emperor on the occasion of your coming among us.

[225:5] I have been aware that some of the enemies of peace have been about to stir your august tribunal against me, and have been waiting to be summoned by your excellency that you might learn the truth from me; if indeed your high wisdom condescends to consider the examination of ecclesiastical matters to be within your province.

[225:6] The tribunal overlooked me, but your excellency, moved by the reproaches of Philochares, ordered my brother and fellow-minister Gregory to be haled before your judgment seat.

[225:7] He obeyed your summons; how could he do otherwise? But he was attacked by pain in the side, and at the same time, in consequence of a chill, was attacked by his old kidney complaint.

[225:8] He has therefore been compelled, forcibly detained by your soldiers as he was, to be conveyed to some quiet spot, where he could have his maladies attended to, and get some comfort in his intolerable agony.

[225:9] Under these circumstances we have combined to approach your lordship with the entreaty that you will feel no anger at the postponement of the trial.

[225:10] The public interests have not in any way suffered through our delay, nor have those of the Church been injured.

[225:11] If there is any question of the wasteful expenditure of money, the treasurers of the Church funds are there, ready to give an account to any one who likes, and to exhibit the injustice of the charges advanced by men who have braved the careful hearing of the case before you.

[225:12] For they can have no difficulty in making the truth clear to any one who seeks it from the actual writings of the blessed bishop himself.

[225:13] If there is any other point of canonical order which requires investigation, and your excellency deigns to undertake to hear and to judge it, it will be necessary for us all to be present, because, if there has been a failure in any point of canonical order, the responsibility lies with the consecrators and not with him who is forcibly compelled to undertake the ministry.

[225:14] We therefore petition you to reserve the hearing of the case for us in our own country, and not to compel us to travel beyond its borders, nor force us to a meeting with bishops with whom we have not yet come to agreement on ecclesiastical questions.

[225:15] I beg you also to be merciful to my own old age and ill health.

[225:16] You will learn by actual investigation, if it please God, that no canonical rule be it small or great was omitted in the appointment of the bishop.

[225:17] I pray that under your administration unity and peace may be brought about with my brethren; but so long as this does not exist it is difficult for us even to meet, because many of our simpler brethren suffer from our mutual disputes.

[226:1] Letter CCXXVI.

[226:2] To the ascetics under him.

[226:3] It may be that the holy God will grant me the joy of a meeting with you, for I am ever longing to see you and hear about you, because in no other thing do I find rest for my soul than in your progress and perfection in the commandments of Christ.

[226:4] But so long as this hope remains unrealized I feel bound to visit you through the instrumentality of our dear and God-fearing brethren, and to address you, my beloved friends, by letter.

[226:5] Wherefore I have sent my reverend and dear brother and fellow-worker in the Gospel, Meletius the presbyter.

[226:6] He will tell you my yearning affection for you, and the anxiety of my soul, in that, night and day, I beseech the Lord in your behalf, that I may have boldness in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ through your salvation, and that when your work is tried by the just judgment of God you may shine forth in the brightness of the saints.

[226:7] At the same time the difficulties of the day cause me deep anxiety, for all Churches have been tossed to and fro, and all souls are being sifted.

[226:8] Some have even opened their mouths without any reserve against their fellow servants.

[226:9] Lies are boldly uttered, and the truth has been hidden.

[226:10] The accused are being condemned without a trial, and the accusers are believed without evidence.

[226:11] I had heard that many letters are being carried about against myself, stinging, gibbeting, and attacking me for matters about which I have my defence ready for the tribunal of truth; and I had intended to keep silence, as indeed I have done; for now for three years I have been bearing the blows of calumny and the whips of accusation, content to think that I have the Lord, Who knows all secrets, as witness of its falsehood.

[226:12] But I see now that many men have silence as a corroboration of these slanders, and have formed the idea that my silence was due, not to my longsuffering, but to my inability to open my lips in opposition to the truth.

[226:13] For these reasons I have attempted to write to you, beseeching your love in Christ not to accept these partial calumnies as true, because, as it is written, the law judges no man unless it have heard and known his actions.

[226:14] 2.

[226:15] Nevertheless before a fair judge the facts themselves are a sufficient demonstration of the truth.

[226:16] Wherefore, even if I be silent, you can look at events.

[226:17] The very men who are now indicting me for heterodoxy have been seen openly numbered with the heretical faction.

[226:18] The very accusers who condemn me for other men's writings, are plainly contravening their own confessions, given to me by them in writing.

[226:19] Look at the conduct of the exhibitors of this audacity.

[226:20] It is their invariable custom to go over to the party in power, to trample on their weaker friends, and to court the strong.

[226:21] The writers of those famous letters against Eudoxius and all his faction, the senders of them to all the brotherhood, the protesters that they shun their communion as fatal to souls, and would not accept the votes given for their deposition, because they were given by heretics, as they persuaded me then,—these very men, completely forgetful of all this, have joined their faction.

[226:22] No room for denial is left them.

[226:23] They laid their mind bare when they embraced private communion with them at Ancyra, when they had not yet been publicly received by them.

[226:24] Ask them, then, if Basilides, who gave communion to Ecdicius, is now orthodox, why when returning from Dardania, did they overthrow his altars in the territory of Gangra, and set up their own tables? Why have they comparatively recently attacked the churches of Amasea and Zela and appointed presbyters and deacons there themselves? If they communicate with them as orthodox, why do they attack them as heretical? If they hold them to be heretical, how is it that they do not shun communion with them? Is it not, my honourable brethren, plain even to the intelligence of a child, that it is always with a view to some personal advantage that they endeavour to calumniate or to give support? So they have stood off from me, not because I did not write in reply (which is alleged to be the main ground of offence), nor because I did not receive the chorepiscopi whom they assert they sent.

[226:25] Those who are trumping up the tale will render an account to the Lord.

[226:26] One man, Eustathius, was sent and gave a letter to the court of the vicar, and spent three days in the city.

[226:27] When he was on the point of going home, it is said that he came to my house late in the evening, when I was asleep.

[226:28] On hearing that I was asleep, he went away; he did not come near me on the next day, and after thus going through the mere form of discharging his duty to me, departed.

[226:29] This is the charge under which I am guilty.

[226:30] This is the sin against which these long-suffering people have neglected to weigh the previous service wherein I served them in love.

[226:31] For this error they have made their wrath against me so severe that they have caused me to be denounced in all the Churches throughout the world—at least, that is, wherever they could.

[226:32] 3.

[226:33] But of course this is not the real cause of our separation.

[226:34] It was when they found that they would recommend themselves to Euzoius if they were alienated from me, that they devised these pretences.

[226:35] The object was to find some ground of recommendation with the authorities for their attack upon me.

[226:36] Now they are beginning to run down even the Nicene Creed, and nickname me Homoousiast, because in that creed the Only begotten Son is said to be homoousios with God the Father.

[226:37] Not that one essence is divided into two kindred parts; God forbid! This was not the meaning of that holy and God-beloved synod; their meaning was that what the Father is in essence, such is the Son.

[226:38] And thus they themselves have explained it to us, in the phrase Light of Light.

[226:39] Now it is the Nicene Creed, brought by themselves from the west, which they presented to the Synod at Tyana, by which they were received.

[226:40] But they have an ingenious theory as to changes of this kind; they use the words of the creed as physicians use a remedy for the particular moment, and substitute now one and now another to suit particular diseases.

[226:41] The unsoundness of such a sophism it is rather for you to consider than for me to prove.

[226:42] For "the Lord will give you understanding" to know what is the right doctrine, and what the crooked and perverse.

[226:43] If indeed we are to subscribe one creed to-day and another tomorrow, and shift with the seasons, then is the declaration false of him who said, "One Lord, one faith, one baptism".

[226:44] But if it is true, then "Let no man deceive you with [these] vain words".

[226:45] They falsely accuse me of introducing novelties about the Holy Spirit.

[226:46] Ask what the novelty is.

[226:47] I confess what I have received, that the Paraclete is ranked with Father and Son, and not numbered with created beings.

[226:48] We have made profession of our faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and we are baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

[226:49] Wherefore we never separate the Spirit from conjunction with the Father and the Son.

[226:50] For our mind, enlightened by the Spirit, looks at the Son, and in Him, as in an image, beholds the Father.

[226:51] And I do not invent names of myself, but call the Holy Ghost Paraclete; nor do I consent to destroy His due glory.

[226:52] These are truly my doctrines.

[226:53] If any one wishes to accuse me for them, let him accuse me; let my persecutor persecute me.

[226:54] Let him who believes in the slanders against me be ready for the judgment.

[226:55] "The Lord is at hand".

[226:56] "I am careful for nothing".

[226:57] 4.

[226:58] If any one in Syria is writing, this is nothing to me.

[226:59] For it is said "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned".

[226:60] Let my own words judge me.

[226:61] Let no one condemn me for other men's errors nor adduce letters written twenty years ago in proof that I would allow communion to the writers of such things.

[226:62] Before these things were written, and before any suspicion of this kind had been stirred against them, I did write as layman to layman.

[226:63] I wrote nothing about the faith in any way like that which they are now carrying about to calumniate me.

[226:64] I sent nothing but a mere greeting to return a friendly communication, for I shun and anathematize as impious alike all who are affected with the unsoundness of Sabellius, and all who maintain the opinions of Arius.

[226:65] If any one says that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are the same, and supposes one thing under several names, and one hypostasis described by three persons, I rank such an one as belonging to the faction of the Jews.

[226:66] Similarly, if any one says that the Son is in essence unlike the Father, or degrades the Holy Ghost into a creature, I anathematize him, and say that he is coming near to the heathen error.

[226:67] But it is impossible for the mouths of my accusers to be restrained by my letter; rather is it likely that they are being irritated at my defence, and are getting up new and more violent attacks against me.

[226:68] But it is not difficult for your ears to be guarded.

[226:69] Wherefore, as far as in you lies, do as I bid you.

[226:70] Keep your heart clear and unprejudiced by their calumnies; and insist on my rendering an account to meet the charges laid against me.

[226:71] If you find that truth is on my side do not yield to lies; if on the other hand you feel that I am feeble in defending myself, then believe my accusers as being worthy of credit.

[226:72] They pass sleepless nights to do me mischief.

[226:73] I do not ask this of you.

[226:74] They are taking to a commercial career, and turning their slanders against me into a means of profit.

[226:75] I implore you on the other hand to stop at home, and to lead a decorous life, quietly doing Christ's work.

[226:76] I advise you to avoid communication with them, for it always tends to the perversion of their hearers.

[226:77] I say this that you may keep your affection for the uncontaminated, may preserve the faith of the Fathers in its integrity, and may appear approved before the Lord as friends of the truth.

[227:1] Letter CCXXVII.

[227:2] Consolatory, to the clergy of Colonia.

[227:3] What is so goodly and honourable before God and men as perfect love, which, as we are told by the wise teacher, is the fulfilling of the law? I therefore approve of your warm affection for your bishop, for, as to an affectionate son the loss of a good father is unendurable, so Christ's Church cannot bear the departure of a pastor and teacher.

[227:4] Thus, in your exceeding affection for your bishop, you are giving proof of a good and noble disposition.

[227:5] But this your good will towards your spiritual father is to be approved so long as it is shewn in reason and moderation; once let it begin to overstep this line, and it is no longer descrying of the same commendation.

[227:6] In the case of your very God-beloved brother, our fellow-minister Euphronius, good government has been shewn by those to whom has been committed the administration of the Church; they have acted as the occasion compelled them, to the gain alike of the Church to which he has been removed and of yourselves from whom he has been taken.

[227:7] Do not look at this as merely of man's ordaining, nor as having been originated by the calculations of men who regard earthly things.

[227:8] Believe that those to whom the anxious care of the Churches belongs have acted, as they have, with the aid of the Holy Spirit; impress this inception of the proceedings on your hearts and do your best to perfect it.

[227:9] Accept quietly and thankfully what has happened, with the conviction that all, who refuse to accept what is ordered in God's Churches by the Churches, are resisting the ordinance of God.

[227:10] Do not enter into a dispute with your Mother Church at Nicopolis.

[227:11] Do not exasperate yourselves against those who have taken the anxious responsibility of your souls.

[227:12] In the firm establishment of things at Nicopolis your part in them may also be preserved; but if some disturbance affects them, though you have protectors beyond number, with the head the heart will be destroyed.

[227:13] It is like men who live on the riverside; when they see some one far up the stream making a strong dam against the current, they know that, in stopping the inrush of the current, he is providing for their safety.

[227:14] Just so those who have now undertaken the weight of the care of the Churches, by protecting the rest, are proving for your own security.

[227:15] You will be sheltered from every storm, while others have to bear the brunt of the attack.

[227:16] But you ought also to consider this; he has not cast you off; he has taken others into his charge.

[227:17] I am not so invidious as to compel the man, who is able to give a share of his good gifts to others, also to confine his favour to you, and to limit it to your own city.

[227:18] A man who puts a fence round a spring, and spoils the outpour of the waters, is not free from the disease of envy, and it is just the same with him who tries to prevent the further flow of abundant teaching.

[227:19] Let him have some care for Nicopolis too, and let your interests be added to his anxieties there.

[227:20] He has received an addition of labour, but there is no diminution in his diligence on your behalf.

[227:21] I am really distressed at one thing that you have said, which seems to me quite extravagant, namely, that if you cannot obtain your object, you will betake yourselves to the tribunals, and put the matter into the hands of men, the great object of whose prayers is the overthrow of the Churches.

[227:22] Take heed lest men, carried away by unwise passions, persuade you, to your hurt, to put in any plea before the courts, and so some catastrophe may ensue, and the weight of the result fall upon the heads of those who have occasioned it.

[227:23] Take my advice.

[227:24] It is offered you in a fatherly spirit.

[227:25] Consent to the arrangement with the very God-beloved bishops, which has been made in accordance with God's will.

[227:26] Wait for my arrival.

[227:27] When I am with you, with God's help, I will give you in person all the exhortations which it has been impossible for me to express in my letter, and will do my utmost to give you all possible consolation, not by word but in deed.

[228:1] Letter CCXXVIII.

[228:2] To the magistrates of Colonia.

[228:3] I have received your lordships' letter, and offered thanks to God most holy, that you, occupied as you are with affairs of state, should not put those of the Church in the second place.

[228:4] I am grateful to think that every one of you has shewn anxiety as though he were acting in his own private interest, nay, in defence of his own life, and that you have written to me in your distress at the removal of your very God-beloved bishop Euphronius.

[228:5] Nicopolis has not really stolen him from you; were she pleading her cause before a judge she might say that she was recovering what is her own.

[228:6] If honourably treated she will tell you, as becomes an affectionate mother, that she will share with you the Father who will give a portion of his grace to each of you: he will not suffer the one to be in any way harmed by the invasion of their adversaries, and at the same time will not deprive you, the other, of the care to which you have been accustomed.

[228:7] Bethink you then of the emergency of the time; apply your best intelligence to understand how good government necessitates a certain course of action; and then pardon the bishops who have adopted this course for the establishment of the Churches of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[228:8] Suggest to yourselves what is becoming you.

[228:9] Your own intelligence needs no instruction.

[228:10] You know how to adopt the counsels of those who love you.

[228:11] It is only natural that you should be unaware of many of the questions that are being agitated, because of our being situated far away in Armenia; but we who are in the midst of affairs and have our ears dinned every day on all sides with news of Churches that are being overthrown, are in deep anxiety lest the common enemy, in envy at the protracted peace of our life, should be able to sow his tares in your ground too, and Armenia, as well as other places, be given over to our adversaries to devour.

[228:12] For the present be still, as not refusing to allow your neighbours to share with you the use of a goodly vessel.

[228:13] Ere long, if the Lord allow me to come to you, you shall, if it seem necessary to you, receive yet greater consolation for what has come to pass.

[229:1] Letter CCXXIX.

[229:2] To the clergy of Nicopolis.

[229:3] I am sure that a work done by one or two pious men is not done without the cooperation of the Holy Spirit.

[229:4] For when nothing merely human is put before us, when holy men are moved to action with no thought of their own personal gratification, and with the sole object of pleasing God, it is plain that it is the Lord Who is directing their hearts.

[229:5] When spiritually-minded men take the lead in counsel, and the Lord's people follow them with consentient hearts, there can be no doubt that their decisions are arrived at with the participation of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who poured out His blood for the Churches' sake.

[229:6] You are therefore right in supposing that our very God-beloved brother and fellow minister Poemenius, who arrived among you at an opportune moment, and discovered this means of consoling you, has been divinely moved.

[229:7] I not only praise his discovery of the right course to take; I much admire the firmness with which, without allowing any delay to intervene, so as to slacken the energy of the petitioners, or to give the opposite party an opportunity of taking precautions, and to set in motion the counterplots of secret foes, he at once crowned his happy course with a successful conclusion.

[229:8] The Lord of His especial grace keep him and his, so that the Church, as becomes her, may remain in a succession in no way degenerate, and not give place to the evil one, who now, if ever, is vexed at the firm establishment of the Churches.

[229:9] 2.

[229:10] I have also written at length to exhort our brethren at Colonia.

[229:11] You, moreover, are bound rather to put up with their frame of mind than to increase their irritation, as though you despised them for their insignificance, or provoked them to a quarrel by your contempt.

[229:12] It is only natural for disputants to act without due counsel, and to manage their own affairs ill with the object of vexing their opponents.

[229:13] And no one is so small as not to be now able to give an occasion, to those who want an occasion, for great troubles.

[229:14] I do not speak at random.

[229:15] I speak from my own experience of my own troubles.

[229:16] From these may God keep you in answer to your prayers.

[229:17] Pray also for me, that I may have a successful journey, and, on my arrival, may share your joy in your present pastor, and with you may find consolation at the departure of our common father.

[230:1] Letter CCXXX.

[230:2] To the magistrates of Nicopolis.

[230:3] The government of the Churches is carried on by those to whom the chief offices in them have been entrusted, but their hands are strengthened by the laity.

[230:4] The measures which lay with the God-beloved bishops have been taken.

[230:5] The rest concerns you, if you deign to accord a hearty reception to the bishop who has been given you, and to make a vigorous resistance to attacks from outside.

[230:6] For nothing is so likely to cause discouragement to all, whether rulers or the rest who envy your peaceful position, as agreement in affection to the appointed bishop, and firmness in maintaining your ground.

[230:7] They are likely to despair of every evil attempt, if they see that their counsels are accepted neither by clergy nor by laity.

[230:8] Bring it about then that your own sentiments as to the right may be shared by all the city, and so speak to the citizens, and to all the inhabitants of the district, in confirmation of their good sentiments, that the genuineness of your love to God may be everywhere known.

[230:9] I trust that it may be permitted me one day to visit and inspect a Church which is the nursing mother of true religion, honoured by me as a metropolis of orthodoxy, because it has from of old been under the government of men right honourable and the elect of God, who have held fast to "the faithful word as we have been taught".

[230:10] You have approved him who has just been appointed as worthy of these predecessors, and I have agreed.

[230:11] May you be preserved by God's grace.

[230:12] May He scatter the evil counsels of our enemies, and fix in your souls strength and constancy to preserve what has been rightly determined on.

[231:1] Letter CCXXXI.

[231:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[231:3] I find few opportunities of writing to your reverence, and this causes me no little trouble.

[231:4] It is just the same as if, when it was in my power to see you and enjoy your society very often, I did so but seldom.

[231:5] But it is impossible for me to write to you because so few travel hence to you, otherwise there is no reason why my letter should not be a kind of journal of my life, to tell you, my dear friend, everything that happens to me day by day.

[231:6] It is a comfort to me to tell you my affairs, and I know that you care for nothing more than for what concerns me.

[231:7] Now, however, Elpidius is going home to his own master, to refute the calumnies falsely got up against him by certain enemies, and he has asked me for a letter.

[231:8] I therefore salute your reverence by him and commend to you a man who deserves your protection, at once for the sake of justice and for my own sake.

[231:9] Although I could say nothing else in his favour, yet, because he has made it of very great importance to be the bearer of my letter, reckon him among our friends, and remember me and pray for the Church.

[231:10] You must know that my very God-beloved brother is in exile, for he could not endure the annoyance caused him by shameless persons.

[231:11] Doara is in a state of agitation, for the fat sea monster is throwing everything into confusion.

[231:12] My enemies, as I am informed by those who know, are plotting against me at court.

[231:13] But hitherto the hand of the Lord has been over me.

[231:14] Only pray that I be not abandoned in the end.

[231:15] My brother is taking things quietly.

[231:16] Doara has received the old muleteer.

[231:17] She can do no more.

[231:18] The Lord will scatter the counsels of my enemies.

[231:19] The one cure for all my troubles present and to come is to set eyes on you.

[231:20] If you possibly can, while I am still alive, do come to see me.

[231:21] The book on the Spirit has been written by me, and is finished, as you know.

[231:22] My brethren here have prevented me from sending it to you written on paper, and have told me that they had your excellency's orders to engross it on parchment.

[231:23] Not, then, to appear to do anything against your injunctions, I have delayed now, but I will send it a little later, if only I find any suitable person to convey it.

[231:24] May you be granted to me and to God's Church by the kindness of the Holy One, in all health and happiness, and praying for me to the Lord.

[232:1] Letter CCXXXII.

[232:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[232:3] Every day that brings me a letter from you is a feast day, the very greatest of feast days.

[232:4] And when symbols of the feast are brought, what can I call it but a feast of feasts, as the old law used to speak of Sabbath of Sabbaths? I thank the Lord that you are quite well, and that you have celebrated the commemoration of the economy of salvation in a Church at peace.

[232:5] I have been disturbed by some troubles; and have not been without distress from the fact of my God-beloved brother being in exile.

[232:6] Pray for him that God may one day grant him to see his Church healed from the wounds of heretical bites.

[232:7] Do come to see me while I am yet upon this earth.

[232:8] Act in accordance with your own wishes and with my most earnest prayers.

[232:9] I may be allowed to be astonished at the meaning of your blessings, inasmuch as you have mysteriously wished me a vigorous old age.

[232:10] By your lamps you rouse me to nightly toil; and by your sweet meats you seem to pledge yourself securely that all my body is in good case.

[232:11] But there is no munching for me at my time of life, for my teeth have long ago been worn away by time and bad health.

[232:12] As to what you have asked me there are some replies in the document I send you, written to the best of my ability, and as opportunity has allowed.

[233:1] Letter CCXXXIII.

[233:2] To Amphilochius, in reply to certain questions.

[233:3] I.

[233:4] I know that I have myself heard of this, and I am aware of the constitution of mankind.

[233:5] What shall I say? The mind is a wonderful thing, and therein we possess that which is after the image of the Creator.

[233:6] And the operation of the mind is wonderful; in that, in its perpetual motion, it frequently forms imaginations about things non-existent as though they were existent, and is frequently carried straight to the truth.

[233:7] But there are in it two faculties; in accordance with the view of us who believe in God, the one evil, that of the daemons which draws us on to their own apostasy; and the divine and the good, which brings us to the likeness of God.

[233:8] When, therefore, the mind remains alone and unaided, it contemplates small things, commensurate with itself.

[233:9] When it yields to those who deceive it, it nullifies its proper judgment, and is concerned with monstrous fancies.

[233:10] Then it considers wood to be no longer wood, but a god; then it looks on gold no longer as money, but as an object of worship.

[233:11] If on the other hand it assents to its diviner part, and accepts the boons of the Spirit, then, so far as its nature admits, it becomes perceptive of the divine.

[233:12] There are, as it were, three conditions of life, and three operations of the mind.

[233:13] Our ways may be wicked, and the movements of our mind wicked; such as adulteries, thefts, idolatries, slanders, strife, passion, sedition, vain-glory, and all that the apostle Paul enumerates among the works of the flesh.

[233:14] Or the soul's operation is, as it were, in a mean, and has nothing about it either damnable or laudable, as the perception of such mechanical crafts as we commonly speak of as indifferent, and, of their own character, inclining neither towards virtue nor towards vice.

[233:15] For what vice is there in the craft of the helmsman or the physician? Neither are these operations in themselves virtues, but they incline in one direction or the other in accordance with the will of those who use them.

[233:16] But the mind which is impregnated with the Godhead of the Spirit is at once capable of viewing great objects; it beholds the divine beauty, though only so far as grace imparts and its nature receives.

[233:17] 2.

[233:18] Let them dismiss, therefore, these questions of dialectics and examine the truth, not with mischievous exactness but with reverence.

[233:19] The judgment of our mind is given us for the understanding of the truth.

[233:20] Now our God is the very truth.

[233:21] So the primary function of our mind is to know one God, but to know Him so far as the infinitely great can be known by the very small.

[233:22] When our eyes are first brought to the perception of visible objects, all visible objects are not at once brought into sight.

[233:23] The hemisphere of heaven is not beheld with one glance, but we are surrounded by a certain appearance, though in reality many things, not to say all things, in it are unperceived;—the nature of the stars, their greatness, their distances, their movements, their conjunctions, their intervals, their other conditions, the actual essence of the firmament, the distance of depth from the concave circumference to the convex surface.

[233:24] Nevertheless, no one would allege the heaven to be invisible because of what is unknown; it would be said to be visible on account of our limited perception of it.

[233:25] It is just the same in the case of God.

[233:26] If the mind has been injured by devils it will be guilty of idolatry, or will be perverted to some other form of impiety.

[233:27] But if it has yielded to the aid of the Spirit, it will have understanding of the truth, and will know God.

[233:28] But it will know Him, as the Apostle says, in part; and in the life to come more perfectly.

[233:29] For "when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away".

[233:30] The judgment of the mind is, therefore, good and given us for a good end—the perception of God; but it operates only so far as it can.

[234:1] Letter CCXXXIV.

[234:2] To the same, in answer to another question.

[234:3] Do you worship what you know or what you do not know? If I answer, I worship what I know, they immediately reply, What is the essence of the object of worship? Then, if I confess that I am ignorant of the essence, they turn on me again and say, So you worship you know not what.

[234:4] I answer that the word to know has many meanings.

[234:5] We say that we know the greatness of God, His power, His wisdom, His goodness, His providence over us, and the justness of His judgment; but not His very essence.

[234:6] The question is, therefore, only put for the sake of dispute.

[234:7] For he who denies that he knows the essence does not confess himself to be ignorant of God, because our idea of God is gathered from all the attributes which I have enumerated.

[234:8] But God, he says, is simple, and whatever attribute of Him you have reckoned as knowable is of His essence.

[234:9] But the absurdities involved in this sophism are innumerable.

[234:10] When all these high attributes have been enumerated, are they all names of one essence? And is there the same mutual force in His awfulness and His loving-kindness, His justice and His creative power, His providence and His foreknowledge, and His bestowal of rewards and punishments, His majesty and His providence? In mentioning any one of these do we declare His essence? If they say, yes, let them not ask if we know the essence of God, but let them enquire of us whether we know God to be awful, or just, or merciful.

[234:11] These we confess that we know.

[234:12] If they say that essence is something distinct, let them not put us in the wrong on the score of simplicity.

[234:13] For they confess themselves that there is a distinction between the essence and each one of the attributes enumerated.

[234:14] The operations are various, and the essence simple, but we say that we know our God from His operations, but do not undertake to approach near to His essence.

[234:15] His operations come down to us, but His essence remains beyond our reach.

[234:16] 2.

[234:17] But, it is replied, if you are ignorant of the essence, you are ignorant of Himself.

[234:18] Retort, If you say that you know His essence, you are ignorant of Himself.

[234:19] A man who has been bitten by a mad dog, and sees a dog in a dish, does not really see any more than is seen by people in good health; he is to be pitied because he thinks he sees what he does not see.

[234:20] Do not then admire him for his announcement, but pity him for his insanity.

[234:21] Recognise that the voice is the voice of mockers, when they say, if you are ignorant of the essence of God, you worship what you do not know.

[234:22] I do know that He exists; what His essence is, I look at as beyond intelligence.

[234:23] How then am I saved? Through faith.

[234:24] It is faith sufficient to know that God exists, without knowing what He is; and "He is a rewarder of them that seek Him".

[234:25] So knowledge of the divine essence involves perception of His incomprehensibility, and the object of our worship is not that of which we comprehend the essence, but of which we comprehend that the essence exists.

[234:26] 3.

[234:27] And the following counter question may also be put to them.

[234:28] "No man hath seen God at any time, the Only-begotten which is in the bosom hath declared him".

[234:29] What of the Father did the Only-begotten Son declare? His essence or His power? If His power, we know so much as He declared to us.

[234:30] If His essence, tell me where He said that His essence was the being unbegotten? When did Abraham worship? Was it not when he believed? And when did he believe? Was it not when he was called? Where in this place is there any testimony in Scripture to Abraham's comprehending? When did the disciples worship Him? Was it not when they saw creation subject to Him? It was from the obedience of sea and winds to Him that they recognised His Godhead.

[234:31] Therefore the knowledge came from the operations, and the worship from the knowledge.

[234:32] "Believest thou that I am able to do this?" "I believe, Lord;" and he worshipped Him.

[234:33] So worship follows faith, and faith is confirmed by power.

[234:34] But if you say that the believer also knows, he knows from what he believes; and vice versa he believes from what he knows.

[234:35] We know God from His power.

[234:36] We, therefore, believe in Him who is known, and we worship Him who is believed in.

[235:1] Letter CCXXXV.

[235:2] To the same, in answer to another question.

[235:3] 1.

[235:4] Which is first in order, knowledge or faith? I reply that generally, in the case of disciples, faith precedes knowledge.

[235:5] But, in our teaching, if any one asserts knowledge to come before faith, I make no objection; understanding knowledge so far as is within the bounds of human comprehension.

[235:6] In our lessons we must first believe that the letter a is said to us; then we learn the characters and their pronunciation, and last of all we get the distinct idea of the force of the letter.

[235:7] But in our belief about God, first comes the idea that God is.

[235:8] This we gather from His works.

[235:9] For, as we perceive His wisdom, His goodness, and all His invisible things from the creation of the world, so we know Him.

[235:10] So, too, we accept Him as our Lord.

[235:11] For since God is the Creator of the whole world, and we are a part of the world, God is our Creator.

[235:12] This knowledge is followed by faith, and this faith by worship.

[235:13] 2.

[235:14] But the word knowledge has many meanings, and so those who make sport of simpler minds, and like to make themselves remarkable by astounding statements (just like jugglers who get the balls out of sight before men's very eyes), hastily included everything in their general enquiry.

[235:15] Knowledge, I say, has a very wide application, and knowledge may be got of what a thing is, by number, by bulk, by force, by its mode of existence, by the period of its generation, by its essence.

[235:16] When then our opponents include the whole in their question, if they catch us in the confession that we know, they straightway demand from us knowledge of the essence; if, on the contrary, they see us cautious as to making any assertion on the subject, they affix on us the stigma of impiety.

[235:17] I, however, confess that I know what is knowable of God, and that I know what it is which is beyond my comprehension.

[235:18] So if you ask me if I know what sand is, and I reply that I do, you will obviously be slandering me, if you straightway ask me the number of the sand; inasmuch as your first enquiry bore only on the form of sand, while your second unfair objection bore upon its number.

[235:19] The quibble is just as though any one were to say, Do you know Timothy? Oh, if you know Timothy you know his nature.

[235:20] Since you have acknowledged that you know Timothy, give me an account of Timothy's nature.

[235:21] Yes; but I at the same time both know and do not know Timothy, though not in the same way and in the same degree.

[235:22] It is not that I do not know in the same way in which I do know; but I know in one way and am ignorant in one way.

[235:23] I know him according to his form and other properties; but I am ignorant of his essence.

[235:24] Indeed, in this way too, I both know, and am ignorant of, myself.

[235:25] I know indeed who I am, but, so far as I am ignorant of my essence I do not know myself.

[235:26] 3.

[235:27] Let them tell me in what sense Paul says, "Now we know in part"; do we know His essence in part, as knowing parts of His essence? No.

[235:28] This is absurd; for God is without parts.

[235:29] But do we know the whole essence? How then "When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away".

[235:30] Why are idolaters found fault with? Is it not because they knew God and did not honour Him as God? Why are the "foolish Galatians" reproached by Paul in the words, "After that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements?" How was God known in Jewry? Was it because in Jewry it was known what His essence is? "The ox," it is said, "knoweth his owner".

[235:31] According to your argument the ox knows his lord's essence.

[235:32] "And the ass his master's crib".

[235:33] So the ass knows the essence of the crib, but "Israel doth not know me".

[235:34] So, according to you, Israel is found fault with for not knowing what the essence of God is.

[235:35] "Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee," that is, who have not comprehended thy essence.

[235:36] But, I repeat, knowledge is manifold—it involves perception of our Creator, recognition of His wonderful works, observance of His commandments and intimate communion with Him.

[235:37] All this they thrust on one side and force knowledge into one single meaning, the contemplation of God's essence.

[235:38] Thou shalt put them, it is said, before the testimony and I shall be known of thee thence.

[235:39] Is the term, "I shall be known of thee," instead of, "I will reveal my essence"? "The Lord knoweth them that are his".

[235:40] Does He know the essence of them that are His, but is ignorant of the essence of those who disobey Him? "Adam knew his wife".

[235:41] Did he know her essence? It is said of Rebekah "She was a virgin, neither had any man known her," and "How shall this be seeing I know not a man?" Did no man know Rebekah's essence? Does Mary mean "I do not know the essence of any man"? Is it not the custom of Scripture to use the word "know" of nuptial embraces? The statement that God shall be known from the mercy seat means that He will be known to His worshippers.

[235:42] And the Lord knoweth them that are His, means that on account of their good works He receives them into intimate communion with Him.

[236:1] Letter CCXXXVI.

[236:2] To the same Amphilochius.

[236:3] 1.

[236:4] Enquiry has already frequently been made concerning the saying of the gospels as to our Lord Jesus Christ's ignorance of the day and of the hour of the end; an objection constantly put forward by the Anomoeans to the destruction of the glory of the Only-Begotten, in order to show Him to be unlike in essence and subordinate in dignity; inasmuch as, if He know not all things, He cannot possess the same nature nor be regarded as of one likeness with Him, who by His own prescience and faculty of forecasting the future has knowledge coextensive with the universe.

[236:5] This question has now been proposed to me by your intelligence as a new one.

[236:6] I can give in reply the answer which I heard from our fathers when I was a boy, and which on account of my love for what is good, I have received without question.

[236:7] I do not expect that it can undo the shamelessness of them that fight against Christ, for where is the reasoning strong enough to stand their attack? It may, however, suffice to convince all that love the Lord, and in whom the previous assurance supplied them by faith is stronger than any demonstration of reason.

[236:8] Now "no man" seems to be a general expression, so that not even one person is excepted by it, but this is not its use in Scripture, as I have observed in the passage "there is none good but one, that is, God".

[236:9] For even in this passage the Son does not so speak to the exclusion of Himself from the good nature.

[236:10] But, since the Father is the first good, we believe the words "no man" to have been uttered with the understood addition of "first".

[236:11] So with the passage "No man knoweth the Son but the Father;" even here there is no charge of ignorance against the Spirit, but only a testimony that knowledge of His own nature naturally belongs to the Father first.

[236:12] Thus also we understand "No man knoweth," to refer to the Father the first knowledge of things, both present and to be, and generally to exhibit to men the first cause.

[236:13] Otherwise how can this passage fall in with the rest of the evidence of Scripture, or agree with the common notions of us who believe that the Only-Begotten is the image of the invisible God, and image not of the bodily figure, but of the very Godhead and of the mighty qualities attributed to the essence of God, image of power, image of wisdom, as Christ is called "the power of God and the wisdom of God"? Now of wisdom knowledge is plainly a part; and if in any part He falls short, He is not an image of the whole; and how can we understand the Father not to have shewn that day and that hour—the smallest portion of the ages—to Him through Whom He made the ages? How can the Creator of the universe fall short of the knowledge of the smallest portion of the things created by Him? How can He who says, when the end is near, that such and such signs shall appear in heaven and in earth, be ignorant of the end itself? When He says, "The end is not yet".

[236:14] He makes a definite statement, as though with knowledge and not in doubt.

[236:15] Then further, it is plain to the fair enquirer that our Lord says many things to men, in the character of man; as for instance, "give me to drink" is a saying of our Lord, expressive of His bodily necessity; and yet the asker was not soulless flesh, but Godhead using flesh endued with soul.

[236:16] So in the present instance no one will be carried beyond the bounds of the interpretation of true religion, who understands the ignorance of him who had received all things according to the oeconomy, and was advancing with God and man in favour and wisdom.

[236:17] 2.

[236:18] It would be worthy of your diligence to set the phrases of the Gospel side by side, and compare together those of Matthew and those of Mark, for these two alone are found in concurrence in this passage.

[236:19] The wording of Matthew is "of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only".

[236:20] That of Mark runs, "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father".

[236:21] What is noticeable in these passages is this; that Matthew says nothing about the ignorance of the Son, and seems to agree with Mark as to sense in saying "but my Father only".

[236:22] Now I understand the word "only" to have been used in contradistinction to the angels, but that the Son is not included with His own servants in ignorance.

[236:23] He could not say what is false Who said "All things that the Father hath are Mine," but one of the things which the Father hath is knowledge of that day and of that hour.

[236:24] In the passage in Matthew, then, the Lord made no mention of His own Person, as a matter beyond controversy, and said that the angels knew not and that His Father alone knew, tacitly asserting the knowledge of His Father to be His own knowledge too, because of what He had said elsewhere, "as the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father," and if the Father has complete knowledge of the Son, nothing excepted, so that He knows all knowledge to dwell in Him, He will clearly be known as fully by the Son with all His inherent wisdom and all His knowledge of things to come.

[236:25] This modification, I think, may be given to the words of Matthew, "but my Father only".

[236:26] Now as to the words of Mark, who appears distinctly to exclude the Son from the knowledge, my opinion is this.

[236:27] No man knoweth, neither the angels of God; nor yet the Son would have known unless the Father had known: that is, the cause of the Son's knowing comes from the Father.

[236:28] To a fair hearer there is no violence in this interpretation, because the word "only" is not added as it is in Matthew.

[236:29] Mark's sense, then, is as follows: of that day and of that hour knoweth no man, nor the angels of God; but even the Son would not have known if the Father had not known, for the knowledge naturally His was given by the Father.

[236:30] This is very decorous and becoming the divine nature to say of the Son, because He has, His knowledge and His being, beheld in all the wisdom and glory which become His Godhead, from Him with Whom He is consubstantial.

[236:31] 3.

[236:32] As to Jeconias, whom the prophet Jeremiah declares in these words to have been rejected from the land of Judah, "Jeconias was dishonoured like a vessel for which there is no more use; and because he was cast out he and his seed; and none shall rise from his seed sitting upon the throne of David and ruling in Judah," the matter is plain and clear.

[236:33] On the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the kingdom had been destroyed, and there was no longer an hereditary succession of reigns as before.

[236:34] Nevertheless, at that time, the deposed descendants of David were living in captivity.

[236:35] On the return of Salathiel and Zerubbabel the supreme government rested to a greater degree with the people, and the sovereignty was afterwards transferred to the priesthood, on account of the intermingling of the priestly and royal tribes; whence the Lord, in things pertaining to God, is both King and High Priest.

[236:36] Moreover, the royal tribe did not fail until the coming of the Christ; nevertheless, the seed of Jeconias sat no longer upon the throne of David.

[236:37] Plainly it is the royal dignity which is described by the term "throne".

[236:38] You remember the history, how all Judaea, Idumaea, Moab, both the neighbouring regions of Syria and the further countries up to Mesopotamia, and the country on the other side as far as the river of Egypt, were all tributary to David.

[236:39] If then none of his descendants appeared with a sovereignty so wide, how is not the word of the prophet true that no one of the seed of Jeconias should any longer sit upon the throne of David, for none of his descendants appears to have attained this dignity.

[236:40] Nevertheless, the tribe of Judah did not fail, until He for whom it was destined came.

[236:41] But even He did not sit upon the material throne.

[236:42] The kingdom of Judaea was transferred to Herod, the son of Antipater the Ascalonite, and his sons who divided Judaea into four principalities, when Pilate was Procurator and Tiberius was Master of the Roman Empire.

[236:43] It is the indestructible kingdom which he calls the throne of David on which the Lord sat.

[236:44] He is the expectation of the Gentiles and not of the smallest division of the world, for it is written, "In that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek".

[236:45] "I have called thee…for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles"; and thus then God remained a priest although He did not receive the sceptre of Judah, and King of all the earth; so the blessing of Jacob was fulfilled, and in Him "shall all the nations of the earth be blessed," and all the nations shall call the Christ blessed.

[236:46] 4.

[236:47] And as to the tremendous question put by the facetious Encratites, why we do not eat everything? Let this answer be given, that we turn with disgust from our excrements.

[236:48] As far as dignity goes, to us flesh is grass; but as to distinction between what is and what is not serviceable, just as in vegetables, we separate the unwholesome from the wholesome, so in flesh we distinguish between that which is good and that which is bad for food.

[236:49] Hemlock is a vegetable, just as vulture's flesh is flesh; yet no one in his senses would eat henbane nor dog's flesh unless he were in very great straits.

[236:50] If he did, however, he would not sin.

[236:51] 5.

[236:52] Next as to those who maintain that human affairs are governed by fate, do not ask information from me, but stab them with their own shafts of rhetoric.

[236:53] The question is too long for my present infirmity.

[236:54] With regard to emerging in baptism—I do not know how it came into your mind to ask such a question, if indeed you understood immersion to fulfil the figure of the three days.

[236:55] It is impossible for any one to be immersed three times, without emerging three times.

[236:56] We write the word φάγος paroxytone.

[236:57] 6.

[236:58] The distinction between οὐσία and ὑπόστασις is the same as that between the general and the particular; as, for instance, between the animal and the particular man.

[236:59] Wherefore, in the case of the Godhead, we confess one essence or substance so as not to give a variant definition of existence, but we confess a particular hypostasis, in order that our conception of Father, Son and Holy Spirit may be without confusion and clear.

[236:60] If we have no distinct perception of the separate characteristics, namely, fatherhood, sonship, and sanctification, but form our conception of God from the general idea of existence, we cannot possibly give a sound account of our faith.

[236:61] We must, therefore, confess the faith by adding the particular to the common.

[236:62] The Godhead is common; the fatherhood particular.

[236:63] We must therefore combine the two and say, "I believe in God the Father".

[236:64] The like course must be pursued in the confession of the Son; we must combine the particular with the common and say "I believe in God the Son," so in the case of the Holy Ghost we must make our utterance conform to the appellation and say "in God the Holy Ghost".

[236:65] Hence it results that there is a satisfactory preservation of the unity by the confession of the one Godhead, while in the distinction of the individual properties regarded in each there is the confession of the peculiar properties of the Persons.

[236:66] On the other hand those who identify essence or substance and hypostasis are compelled to confess only three Persons, and, in their hesitation to speak of three hypostases, are convicted of failure to avoid the error of Sabellius, for even Sabellius himself, who in many places confuses the conception, yet, by asserting that the same hypostasis changed its form to meet the needs of the moment, does endeavour to distinguish persons.

[236:67] 7.

[236:68] Lastly as to your enquiry in what manner things neutral and indifferent are ordained for us, whether by some chance working by its own accord, or by the righteous providence of God, my answer is this: Health and sickness, riches and poverty, credit and discredit, inasmuch as they do not render their possessors good, are not in the category of things naturally good, but, in so far as in any way they make life's current flow more easily, in each case the former is to be preferred to its contrary, and has a certain kind of value.

[236:69] To some men these things are given by God for stewardship's sake, as for instance to Abraham, to Job and such like.

[236:70] To inferior characters they are a challenge to improvement.

[236:71] For the man who persists in unrighteousness, after so goodly a token of love from God, subjects himself to condemnation without defence.

[236:72] The good man, however, neither turns his heart to wealth when he has it, nor seeks after it if he has it not.

[236:73] He treats what is given him as given him not for his selfish enjoyment, but for wise administration.

[236:74] No one in his senses runs after the trouble of distributing other people's property, unless he is trying to get the praise of the world, which admires and envies anybody in authority.

[236:75] Good men take sickness as athletes take their contest, waiting for the crowns that are to reward their endurance.

[236:76] To ascribe the dispensation of these things to any one else is as inconsistent with true religion as it is with common sense.

[237:1] Letter CCXXXVII.

[237:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[237:3] 1.

[237:4] I both wrote to your reverence by the vicar of Thrace, and sent other letters by one of the officers of the treasury of Philippopolis, who was starting from our country into Thrace, and begged him to take them on his departure.

[237:5] But the vicar never received my letter, for while I was visiting my diocese, he came into town in the evening and started early in the morning, so that the church officers did not know of his coming, and the letter remained at my house.

[237:6] The treasurer, too, on account of some unexpected and urgent business, set out without seeing me or taking my letters.

[237:7] No one else could be found; so I remained, sorry at not being able to write to you and at not receiving any letter from your reverence.

[237:8] Yet I was wishful, were it possible, to tell you all that happens to me day by day.

[237:9] So many astonishing things happen as to need a daily narrative, and you may be sure that I would have written one, unless my mind had been diverted from its purpose by the pressure of events.

[237:10] 2.

[237:11] The first and greatest of my troubles was the visit of the Vicar.

[237:12] As to whether he is a man really heretically minded I do not know; for I think that he is quite unversed in doctrine, and has not the slightest interest or experience in such things, for I see him day and night busy, both in body and soul, in other things.

[237:13] But he is certainly a friend of heretics; and he is not more friendly to them than he is ill-disposed to me.

[237:14] He has summoned a synod of wicked men in mid-winter in Galatia.

[237:15] He has deposed Hypsinus and set up Ecdicius in his place.

[237:16] He has ordered the removal of my brother on the accusation of one man, and that one quite insignificant.

[237:17] Then, after being occupied for some little time about the army, he came to us again breathing rage and slaughter, and, in one sentence, delivered all the Church of Caesarea to the Senate.

[237:18] He settled for several days at Sebaste, separating friends from foes, calling those in communion with me senators, and condemning them to the public service, while he advanced the adherents of Eustathius.

[237:19] He has ordered a second synod of bishops of Galatia and Pontus to be assembled at Nyssa.

[237:20] They have submitted, have met, and have sent to the Churches a man of whose character I do not like to speak; but your reverence can well understand what sort of a man he must be who would put himself at the disposal of such counsels of men.

[237:21] Now, while I am thus writing, the same gang have hurried to Sebaste to unite with Eustathius, and, with him, to upset the Church of Nicopolis.

[237:22] For the blessed Theodotus has fallen asleep.

[237:23] Hitherto the Nicopolitans have bravely and stoutly resisted the vicar's first assault; for he tried to persuade them to receive Eustathius, and to accept their bishop on his appointment.

[237:24] But, on seeing them unwilling to yield, he is now trying, by yet more violent action, to effect the establishment of the bishop whom it has been attempted to give them.

[237:25] There is, moreover, said to be some rumoured expectation of a synod, by which means they mean to summon me to receive them into communion, or to be friendly with them.

[237:26] Such is the position of the Churches.

[237:27] As to my own health, I think it better to say nothing.

[237:28] I cannot bear not to tell the truth, and by telling the truth I shall only grieve you.

[238:1] Letter CCXXXVIII.

[238:2] To the presbyters of Nicopolis.

[238:3] I have received your letter, my reverend brethren, but it told me nothing that I did not already know, for the whole country round about was already full of the report announcing the disgrace of that one among you who has fallen, and through lust of vain glory has brought on himself very shameful dishonour, and has through his self-love lost the rewards promised to faith.

[238:4] Nay, through the just hatred of them that fear the Lord he misses even that contemptible little glory for lust of which he has been sold to impiety.

[238:5] By the character he has now shown he has very plainly proved, concerning all his life, that he has never at any time lived in hope of the promises laid up for us by the Lord, but, in all his transactions of human affairs, has used words of faith and mockery of piety, all to deceive every one whom he met.

[238:6] But how are you injured? Are you any worse off for this than you were before? One of your number has fallen away, and if one or two others have gone with him, they are to be pitied for their fall, but, by God's grace, your body is whole.

[238:7] The useless part has gone, and what is left has not suffered mutilation.

[238:8] You are haply distressed that you are driven without the walls, but you shall dwell under the protection of the God of Heaven, and the angel who watches over the Church has gone out with you.

[238:9] So they lie down in empty places day by day, bringing upon themselves heavy judgment through the dispersion of the people.

[238:10] And, if in all this there is sorrow to be borne, I trust in the Lord that it will not be without its use to you.

[238:11] Therefore, the more have been your trials, look for a more perfect reward from your just Judge.

[238:12] Do not take your present troubles ill.

[238:13] Do not lose hope.

[238:14] Yet a little while and your Helper will come to you and will not tarry.

[239:1] Letter CCXXXIX.

[239:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[239:3] 1.

[239:4] The Lord has granted me the privilege of now saluting your holiness by our beloved and very reverend brother, the presbyter Antiochus, of exhorting you to pray for me as you are wont, and offering in our communication by letter some consolation for our long separation.

[239:5] And, when you pray, I ask you to beg from the Lord this as the first and greatest boon, that I may be delivered from vile and wicked men, who have gained such power over the people that now I seem to see, indeed, a repetition of the events of the taking of Jerusalem.

[239:6] For the weaker grow the Churches the more does men's lust for power increase.

[239:7] And now the very title of bishop has been conferred on wretched slaves, for no servant of God would choose to come forward in opposition to claim the see;—no one but miserable fellows like the emissaries of Anysius the creature of Euippius, and of Ecdicius of Parnassus: whoever has appointed him has sent into the Churches a poor means of aiding his own entry into the life to come.

[239:8] They have expelled my brother from Nyssa, and into his place have introduced hardly a man—a mere scamp worth only an obol or two, but, so far as regards the ruin of the faith, a match for those who have put him where he is.

[239:9] At the town of Doara they have brought shame upon the poor name of bishop, and have sent there a wretch, an orphans' domestic, a runaway from his own masters, to flatter a godless woman, who formerly used George as she liked, and now has got this fellow to succeed him.

[239:10] And who could properly lament the occurrences at Nicopolis? That unhappy Fronto did, indeed, for a while pretend to be on the side of the truth, but now he has shamefully betrayed both the faith and himself, and for the price of his betrayal has got a name of disgrace.

[239:11] He imagines that he has obtained from these men the rank of bishop; in reality he has become, by God's grace, the abomination of all Armenia.

[239:12] But there is nothing that they will not dare; nothing wherein they are at a loss for worthy accomplices.

[239:13] But the rest of the news of Syria my brother knows better, and can tell you better, than I.

[239:14] 2.

[239:15] The news of the West you know already, on the recital of brother Dorotheus.

[239:16] What sort of letters are to be given him on his departure? Perhaps he will travel with the excellent Sanctissimus, who is full of enthusiasm, journeying through the East, and collecting letters and signatures from all the men of mark.

[239:17] What ought to be written by them, or how I can come to an agreement with those who are writing, I do not know.

[239:18] If you hear of any one soon travelling my way, be so good as to let me know.

[239:19] I am moved to say, as Diomede said,  "Would God, Atrides, thy request were yet to undertake;  …he's proud enough".

[239:20] Really lofty souls, when they are courted, get haughtier than ever.

[239:21] If the Lord be propitious to us, what other thing do we need? If the anger of the Lord lasts on, what help can come to us from the frown of the West? Men who do not know the truth, and do not wish to learn it, but are prejudiced by false suspicions, are doing now as they did in the case of Marcellus, when they quarrelled with men who told them the truth, and by their own action strengthened the cause of heresy.

[239:22] Apart from the common document, I should like to have written to their Coryphaeus—nothing, indeed, about ecclesiastical affairs except gently to suggest that they know nothing of what is going on here, and will not accept the only means whereby they might learn it.

[239:23] I would say, generally, that they ought not to press hard on men who are crushed by trials.

[239:24] They must not take dignity for pride.

[239:25] Sin only avails to produce enmity against God.

[240:1] Letter CCXL.

[240:2] To the Presbyters of Nicopolis.

[240:3] 1.

[240:4] You have done quite right in sending me a letter, and in sending it by the hands of one who, even if you had not written, would have been perfectly competent to give me considerable comfort in all my anxieties, and an authentic report as to the position of affairs.

[240:5] Many vague rumours were continually reaching me, and therefore I was desirous of getting information on many points from some one able to give it through accurate knowledge.

[240:6] Touching all these I have received a satisfactory and intelligent narrative from our well-beloved and honourable brother Theodosius the presbyter.

[240:7] I now write to your reverences the advice which I give myself, for in many respects our positions are identical; and that not only at the present moment, but in times gone by too, as many instances may prove.

[240:8] Of some of these we possess records in writing; others we have received through unwritten recollection from persons acquainted with the facts.

[240:9] We know how, for the sake of the name of the Lord, trials have beset alike individuals and cities that have put their trust in Him.

[240:10] Nevertheless, one and all have passed away, and the distress caused by the days of darkness has not been everlasting.

[240:11] For just as when hail-storm and flood, and all natural calamities, at once injure and destroy things that have no strength, while they are only themselves affected by falling on the strong, so the terrible trials set in action against the Church have been proved feebler than the firm foundation of our faith in Christ.

[240:12] The hail-storm has passed away; the torrent has rushed over its bed; clear sky has taken the place of the former, and the latter has left the course without water and dry, over which it travelled, and has disappeared in the deep.

[240:13] So, too, in a little while the storm, now bursting upon us, will cease to be.

[240:14] But this will be on the condition of our being willing not to look to the present, but to gaze in hope at the future somewhat further off.

[240:15] 2.

[240:16] Is the trial heavy, my brethren? Let us endure the toil.

[240:17] No one who shuns the blows and the dust of battle wins a crown.

[240:18] Are those mockeries of the devil, and the enemies sent to attack us, insignificant? They are troublesome because they are his ministers, but contemptible because God has in them combined wickedness with weakness.

[240:19] Let us beware of being condemned for crying out too loud over a little pain.

[240:20] Only one thing is worth anguish, the loss of one's own self, when for the sake of the credit of the moment, if one can really call making a public disgrace of one's self credit, one has deprived one's self of the everlasting reward of the just.

[240:21] You are children of confessors; you are children of martyrs; you have resisted sin unto blood.

[240:22] Use, each one of you, the examples of those near and dear to you to make you brave for true religion's sake.

[240:23] No one of us has been torn by lashes; no one of us has suffered confiscation of his house; we have not been driven into exile; we have not suffered imprisonment.

[240:24] What great suffering have we undergone, unless peradventure it is grievous that we have suffered nothing, and have not been reckoned worthy of the sufferings of Christ? But if you are grieved because one whom I need not name occupies the house of prayer, and you worship the Lord of heaven and earth in the open air, remember that the eleven disciples were shut up in the upper chamber, when they that had crucified the Lord were worshipping in the Jews' far-famed temple.

[240:25] Peradventure, Judas, who preferred death by hanging to life in disgrace, proved himself a better man than those who now meet universal condemnation without a blush.

[240:26] 3.

[240:27] Only do not be deceived by their lies when they claim to be of the right faith.

[240:28] They are not Christians, but traffickers in Christ, always preferring their profit in this life to living in accordance with the truth.

[240:29] When they thought that they should get this empty dignity, they joined the enemies of Christ: now that they have seen the indignation of the people, they are once more for pretending orthodoxy.

[240:30] I do not recognise as bishop—I would not count among Christ's clergy—a man who has been promoted to a chief post by polluted hands, to the destruction of the faith.

[240:31] This is my decision.

[240:32] If you have any part with me, you will doubtless think as I do.

[240:33] If you take counsel on your own responsibility, every man is master of his own mind, and I am innocent of this blood.

[240:34] I have written thus, not because I distrust you, but that by declaring my own mind I may strengthen some men's hesitation, and prevent any one from being prematurely received into communion, or after receiving the laying on of hands of our enemies, when peace is made, later on, trying to force me to enroll them in the ranks of the sacred ministry.

[240:35] Through you I salute the clergy of the city and diocese, and all the laity who fear the Lord.

[241:1] Letter CCXLI.

[241:2] To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.

[241:3] It is not to increase your distress that I am so lavish of painful topics in my letters to your excellency.

[241:4] My object is to get some comfort for myself in the lamentations which are a kind of natural means of dispersing deep-seated pain whenever they are produced, and further to rouse you, my great-hearted friend, to more earnest prayer on behalf of the Churches.

[241:5] We know that Moses prayed continually for the people; yet, when his battle with Amalek had begun, he did not let down his hands from morning to evening, and the uplifting of the hands of the saint only ended with the end of the fight.

[242:1] Letter CCXLII.

[242:2] To the Westerns.

[242:3] 1.

[242:4] The Holy God has promised a happy of issue out of all their infirmities to those that trust in Him.

[242:5] We, therefore, though we have been cut off in a mid-ocean of troubles, though we are tossed by the great waves raised up against us by the spirits of wickedness, nevertheless hold out in Christ Who strengthens us.

[242:6] We have not slackened the strength of our zeal for the Churches, nor, as though despairing of our salvation, while the billows in the tempest rise above our heads, do we look to be destroyed.

[242:7] On the contrary, we are still holding out with all possible earnestness, remembering how even he who was swallowed by the sea monster, because he did not despair of his life, but cried to the Lord, was saved.

[242:8] Thus too we, though we have reached the last pitch of peril, do not give up our hope in God.

[242:9] On every side we see His succour round about us.

[242:10] For these reasons now we turn our eyes to you, right honourable brethren.

[242:11] In many an hour of our affliction we have expected that you would be at our side; and disappointed in that hope we have said to ourselves, "I looked for some to take pity and there was none; and for comforters but I found none".

[242:12] Our sufferings are such as to have reached the confines of the empire; and since, when one member suffers, all the members suffer, it is doubtless right that your pity should be shown to us who have been so long in trouble.

[242:13] For that sympathy, which we have hoped you of your charity feel for us, is caused less by nearness of place than by union of spirit.

[242:14] 2.

[242:15] How comes it to pass then that we have received nothing of what is due to us by the law of love; no letter of consolation, no visit from brethren? This is now the thirteenth year since the war of heresy began against us.

[242:16] In this the Churches have suffered more tribulations than all those which are on record since Christ's gospel was first preached.

[242:17] I am unwilling to describe these one by one, lest the feebleness of my narrative should make the evidence of the calamities less convincing.

[242:18] It is moreover the less necessary for me to tell you of them, because you have long known what has happened from the reports which will have reached you.

[242:19] The sum and substance of our troubles is this: the people have left the houses of prayer and are holding congregations in the wildernesses.

[242:20] It is a sad sight.

[242:21] Women, boys, old men, and those who are in other ways infirm, remain in the open air, in heavy rain, in the snow, the gales and the frost of winter as well as in summer under the blazing heat of the sun.

[242:22] All this they are suffering because they refuse to have anything to do with the wicked leaven of Arius.

[242:23] 3.

[242:24] How could mere words give you any clear idea of all this without your being stirred to sympathy by personal experience and the evidence of eyewitnesses? We implore you, therefore, to stretch out a helping hand to those that have already been stricken to the ground, and to send messengers to remind us of the prizes in store for the reward of all who patiently suffer for Christ.

[242:25] A voice that we are used to is naturally less able to comfort us than one which sounds from afar, and that one coming from men who over all the world are known by God's grace to be among the noblest; for common report everywhere represents you as having remained steadfast, without suffering a wound in your faith, and as having kept the deposit of the apostles inviolate.

[242:26] This is not our case.

[242:27] There are among us some who, through lust of glory and that puffing up which is especially wont to destroy the souls of Christian men, have audaciously uttered certain novelties of expression with the result that the Churches have become like cracked pots and pans and have let in the inrush of heretical impurity.

[242:28] But do you, whom we love and long for, be to us as surgeons for the wounded, as trainers for the whole, healing the limb that is diseased, and anointing the limb that is sound for the service of the true religion.

[243:1] Letter CCXLIII.

[243:2] To the bishops of Italy and Gaul concerning the condition and confusion of the Churches.

[243:3] 1.

[243:4] To his brethren truly God-beloved and very dear, and fellow ministers of like mind, the bishops of Gaul and Italy, Basil, bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia.

[243:5] Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has deigned to style the universal Church of God His body, and has made us individually members one of another, has moreover granted to all of us to live in intimate association with one another, as befits the agreement of the members.

[243:6] Wherefore, although we dwell far away from one another, yet, as regards our close conjunction, we are very near.

[243:7] Since, then, the head cannot say to the feet, I have no need of you, you will not, I am sure, endure to reject us; you will, on the contrary, sympathize with us in the troubles to which, for our sins, we have been given over, in proportion as we rejoice together with you in your glorying in the peace which the Lord has bestowed on you.

[243:8] Ere now we have also at another time invoked your charity to send us succour and sympathy; but our punishment was not full, and you were not suffered to rise up to succour us.

[243:9] One chief object of our desire is that through you the state of confusion in which we are situated should be made known to the emperor of your part of the world.

[243:10] If this is difficult, we beseech you to send envoys to visit and comfort us in our affliction, that you may have the evidence of eyewitnesses of those sufferings of the East which cannot be told by word of mouth, because language is inadequate to give a clear report of our condition.

[243:11] 2.

[243:12] Persecution has come upon us, right honourable brethren, and persecution in the severest form.

[243:13] Shepherds are persecuted that their flocks may be scattered.

[243:14] And the worst of all is that those who are being treated ill cannot accept their sufferings in proof of their testimony, nor can the people reverence the athletes as in the army of martyrs, because the name of Christians is applied to the persecutors.

[243:15] The one charge which is now sure to secure severe punishment is the careful keeping of the traditions of the Fathers.

[243:16] For this the pious are exiled from their homes, and are sent away to dwell in distant regions.

[243:17] No reverence is shown by the judges of iniquity to the hoary head, to practical piety, to the life lived from boyhood to old age according to the Gospel.

[243:18] No malefactor is doomed without proof, but bishops have been convicted on calumny alone, and are consigned to penalties on charges wholly unsupported by evidence.

[243:19] Some have not even known who has accused them, nor been brought before any tribunal, nor even been falsely accused at all.

[243:20] They have been apprehended with violence late at night, have been exiled to distant places, and, through the hardships of these remote wastes, have been given over to death.

[243:21] The rest is notorious, though I make no mention of it—the flight of priests; the flight of deacons; the foraying of all the clergy.

[243:22] Either the image must be worshipped, or we are delivered to the wicked flame of whips.

[243:23] The laity groan; tears are falling without ceasing in public and in private; all are mutually lamenting their woes.

[243:24] No one's heart is so hard as to lose a father, and bear the bereavement meekly.

[243:25] There is a sound of them that mourn in the city—a sound in the fields, in the roads, in the deserts.

[243:26] But one voice is heard from all that utter sad and piteous words.

[243:27] Joy and spiritual gladness are taken away.

[243:28] Our feasts are turned into mourning.

[243:29] Our houses of prayer are shut.

[243:30] The altars of the spiritual service are lying idle.

[243:31] Christians no longer assemble together; teachers no longer preside.

[243:32] The doctrines of salvation are no longer taught.

[243:33] We have no more solemn assemblies, no more evening hymns, no more of that blessed joy of souls which arises in the souls of all that believe in the Lord at communions, and the imparting of spiritual boons.

[243:34] We may well say, "Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or reader, or offering, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy".

[243:35] 3.

[243:36] We are writing to those who know these things, for there is not a region of the world which is ignorant of our calamities.

[243:37] Do not suppose that we are using these words as though to give information, or to recall ourselves to your recollection.

[243:38] We know that you could no more forget us than a mother forget the sons of her womb.

[243:39] But all who are crushed by any weight of agony find some natural alleviation for their pain in uttering groans of distress, and it is for this that we are doing as we do.

[243:40] We get rid of the load of our grief in telling you of our manifold misfortunes, and in expressing the hope that you may haply be the more moved to pray for us, and may prevail on the Lord to be reconciled to us.

[243:41] And if these afflictions had been confined to ourselves, we might even have determined to keep silence, and to rejoice in our sufferings for Christ's sake, since "the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us".

[243:42] But at the present time we are alarmed, lest the mischief growing day by day, like a flame spreading through some burning wood, when it has consumed what is close at hand, may catch distant objects too.

[243:43] The plague of heresy is spreading, and there is ground of apprehension lest, when it has devoured our Churches, it may afterwards creep on even so far as to the sound portion of your district.

[243:44] Peradventure it is because with us iniquity has abounded that we have been first delivered to be devoured by the cruel teeth of the enemies of God.

[243:45] But the gospel of the kingdom began in our regions, and then went forth over all the world.

[243:46] So, peradventure—and this is most probable—the common enemy of our souls, is striving to bring it about that the seeds of apostasy, originating in the same quarter, should be distributed throughout the world.

[243:47] For the darkness of impiety plots to come upon the very hearts whereon the "light of the knowledge" of Christ has shone.

[243:48] 4.

[243:49] Reckon then, as true disciples of the Lord, that our sufferings are yours.

[243:50] We are not being attacked for the sake of riches, or glory, or any temporal advantages.

[243:51] We stand in the arena to fight for our common heritage, for the treasure of the sound faith, derived from our Fathers.

[243:52] Grieve with us, all ye who love the brethren, at the shutting of the mouths of our men of true religion, and at the opening of the bold and blasphemous lips of all that utter unrighteousness against God.

[243:53] The pillars and foundation of the truth are scattered abroad.

[243:54] We, whose insignificance has allowed of our being overlooked, are deprived of our right of free speech.

[243:55] Do ye enter into the struggle, for the people's sake.

[243:56] Do not think only of your being yourselves moored in a safe haven, where the grace of God gives you shelter from the tempest of the winds of wickedness.

[243:57] Reach out a helping hand to the Churches that are being buffeted by the storm, lest, if they be abandoned, they suffer complete shipwreck of the faith.

[243:58] Lament for us, in that the Only-begotten is being blasphemed, and there is none to offer contradiction.

[243:59] The Holy Ghost is being set at nought and he who is able to confute the error has been sent into exile.

[243:60] Polytheism has prevailed.

[243:61] Our opponents own a great God and a small God.

[243:62] "Son" is no longer a name of nature, but is looked upon as a title of some kind of honour.

[243:63] The Holy Ghost is regarded not as complemental of the Holy Trinity, nor as participating in the divine and blessed Nature, but as in some sort one of the number of created beings, and attached to Father and Son, at mere haphazard and as occasion may require.

[243:64] "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears," and I will weep many days for the people who are being driven to destruction by these vile doctrines.

[243:65] The ears of the simple are being led astray, and have now got used to heretical impiety.

[243:66] The nurslings of the Church are being brought up in the doctrines of iniquity.

[243:67] What are they to do? Our opponents have the command of baptisms; they speed the dying on their way; they visit the sick; they console the sorrowful; they aid the distressed; they give succour of various kinds; they communicate the mysteries.

[243:68] All these things, as long as the performance of them is in their hands, are so many ties to bind the people to their views.

[243:69] The result will be that in a little time, even if some liberty be conceded to us, there is small hope that they who have been long under the influence of error will be recalled to recognition of the truth.

[243:70] 5.

[243:71] Under these circumstances it would have been well for many of us to have travelled to your reverences, and to have individually reported each his own position.

[243:72] You may now take as a proof of the sore straits in which we are placed the fact that we are not even free to travel abroad.

[243:73] For if any one leaves his Church, even for a very brief space, he will leave his people at the mercy of those who are plotting their ruin.

[243:74] By God's mercy instead of many we have sent one, our very reverend and beloved brother the presbyter Dorotheus.

[243:75] He is fully able to supply by his personal report whatever has been omitted in our letter, for he has carefully followed all that has occurred, and is jealous of the right faith.

[243:76] Receive him in peace, and speedily send him back to us, bringing us good news of your readiness to succour the brotherhood.

[244:1] Letter CCXLIV.

[244:2] To Patrophilus, bishop of aegae.

[244:3] 1.

[244:4] I have read, and read with pleasure, the letter which you have sent by Strategius the presbyter.

[244:5] How should I not so read it, written as it is by a wise man, and dictated by a heart which has learned to observe the universal love taught by the commandment of the Lord? Possibly I am not unaware of the reasons which have hitherto kept you silent.

[244:6] You have been, as it were, amazed and astounded, at the idea of the change in the notorious Basil.

[244:7] Why, ever since he was a boy he did such and such service to such an one; at such and such times he did such and such things; he waged war against foes innumerable for the sake of his allegiance to one man; now he has become a totally different character; he has exchanged love for war; he is all that you have written; so you naturally shew considerable astonishment at the very unexpected turn of affairs.

[244:8] And if you have found some fault, I do not take it ill.

[244:9] I am not so beyond correction as to be amazed at the affectionate rebukes of my brothers.

[244:10] Indeed so far was I from being vexed at your letter that it really almost made me laugh to think that when there were, as I thought, so many strong causes already existing to cement our friendship, you should have expressed such very great astonishment at the trifles which have been reported to you.

[244:11] So truly have you suffered the fate of all those who omit to enquire into the nature of circumstances, and give heed to the men who are being discussed; of all who do not examine into the truth, but judge by the distinction of persons, in forgetfulness of the exhortion "Ye shall not respect persons in judgment".

[244:12] 2.

[244:13] Nevertheless, since God in judgment of man does not accept persons, I will not refuse to make known to you the defence which I have prepared for the great tribunal.

[244:14] On my side, from the beginning, there has been no cause of quarrel, either small or great; but men who hate me, for what reason is best known to themselves (I must not say a word about them), incessantly calumniated me.

[244:15] I cleared myself again and again of slanders.

[244:16] There seemed no end to the matter, and no good came of my continual defence, because I was far away, and the authors of the false statements, being on the spot, were able by their calumnies against me to wound a susceptible heart, and one which has never learnt to keep one ear open for the absent.

[244:17] When the Nicopolitans, as you yourself are partly aware, were asking for some proof of faith, I determined to have recourse to the written document.

[244:18] I thought that I should fulfil two objects at once; I expected both to persuade the Nicopolitans not to think ill of the man, and to shut the mouths of my calumniators, because agreement in faith would exclude slander on both sides.

[244:19] Indeed the creed had been drawn up, and it was brought from me, and signed.

[244:20] After it had been signed, a place was appointed for a second meeting, and another date fixed, so that my brethren in the diocese might come together and be united with one another, and our communion for the future be genuine and sincere.

[244:21] I, for my part, arrived at the appointed time, and, of the brethren who act with me, some were on the spot, and others were hurrying thither, all joyous and eager as though on the high road to peace.

[244:22] Couriers and a letter from myself announced my arrival; for the spot appointed for the reception of those who were assembling was mine.

[244:23] But nobody appeared on the other side; no one came in advance; no one to announce the approach of the expected bishops.

[244:24] So those who had been sent by me returned with the report of the deep dejection and the complaints of those who were assembled, as though a new creed had been promulgated by me.

[244:25] They were moreover said to be for deciding, that they certainly would not suffer their bishop to go over to me.

[244:26] Then came a messenger bringing me a letter hastily drawn up, and containing no mention of the points originally agreed on.

[244:27] My brother Theophilus, a man worthy of all respect and honour at my hands, sent one of his adherents, and made certain announcements, which he thought it not improper for him to utter, nor unbecoming in me to hear.

[244:28] He did not condescend to write, not so much because he was afraid of being convicted on written evidence, as because he was anxious not to be compelled to address me as bishop.

[244:29] Assuredly his language was violent, and came from a heart a vehemently agitated.

[244:30] Under these circumstances I departed abashed and depressed, not knowing what to answer to my questioners.

[244:31] Then, without any long interval of time, there was the journey into Cilicia, the return thence, and forthwith a letter repudiating communion with me.

[244:32] 3.

[244:33] The cause of the rupture was the allegation that I wrote to Apollinarius and was in communion with the presbyter Diodorus.

[244:34] I never regarded Apollinarius as an enemy, and for some reasons I even respect him.

[244:35] But I never so far united myself to him as to take upon me the charges against him; indeed I have myself some accusations to bring against him after reading some of his books.

[244:36] I do not know that I ever asked him for a book on the Holy Spirit, or received it on his sending: I am told that he has become a most copious writer, but I have read very few of his works.

[244:37] I have not even time to investigate such matters.

[244:38] Indeed I shrink from admitting any of the more recent works, for my health does not even allow of my reading the inspired Scriptures with diligence and as I ought.

[244:39] What, then, is it to me, if some one has written something displeasing to somebody else? Yet if one man is to render an account on behalf of another, let him who accuses me for Apollinarius' sake defend himself to me for the sake of Arius his own master and of Aetius his own disciple.

[244:40] I never learnt anything from, nor taught anything to this man whose guilt is laid at my door.

[244:41] Diodorus, as a nursling of the blessed Silvanus, I did receive from the beginning: I love him now and respect him on account of his grace of speech, whereby many who meet him are made the better men.

[244:42] 4.

[244:43] At this letter I was affected in such a manner as might be expected, and astounded at so sudden and pleasant a change.

[244:44] I felt quite unable to reply.

[244:45] My heart could hardly beat; my tongue failed me, and my hand grew numb.

[244:46] I felt like a poor creature (for the truth shall be told; yet it is pardonable); I all but fell into a state of misanthropy; I looked on every one with suspicion and thought that there was no charity to be found in mankind.

[244:47] Charity seemed a mere specious word, serving as a kind of decoration to those who use it, while no such sentiment was really to be found in the heart of man.

[244:48] Could it really be that one who seemed to have disciplined himself from boyhood to old age, could be so easily brutalized on such grounds, without a thought for me, without any idea that his experience of bygone years ought to have more weight than this wretched slander? Could he really, like an unbroken colt as yet untaught to carry his rider properly, on some petty suspicion rear and unseat his rider and fling to the ground what was once his pride? If so, what must be thought of the rest with whom I had no such strong ties of friendship, and who had given no such proofs of a well trained life? All this I turned over in my soul and continually revolved in my heart, or, shall I rather say my heart was turned over by these things fighting and pricking me at the recollection of them? I wrote no answer; not that I kept silence from contempt; do not think it of me my brother, for I am not defending myself to men but I speak before God in Christ.

[244:49] I kept silence from utter inability to say a word commensurate with my grief.

[244:50] 5.

[244:51] While I was in this position another letter came to me, addressed to a certain Dazizas, but in reality written to all the world.

[244:52] This is obvious from its very rapid distribution, for in a few days it was delivered all over Pontus, and was travelling about Galatia; indeed it is said that the carriers of this good news traversed Bithynia, and reached the Hellespont itself.

[244:53] What was written against me to Dazizas you are very well aware, for they do not reckon you as so far beyond the bounds of their friendship as to have left you alone undistinguished by this honour.

[244:54] However, if the letter has not reached you, I will send it to you.

[244:55] In it you will find me charged with craft and treachery, with corruption of Churches and with ruin of souls.

[244:56] The charge which they think the truest of all is, that I made that exposition of the faith for secret and dishonest reasons, not to do service to the Nicopolitans, but with the design of disingenously extracting a confession from them.

[244:57] Of all this the Lord is Judge.

[244:58] What clear evidence can there be of the thoughts of the heart? One thing I do wonder at in them, that after signing the document presented by me, they show so much disagreement, that they confuse truth and falsehood to satisfy those who are accusing them, quite forgetful that their written confession of the Nicene Creed is preserved at Rome, and that they with their own hand delivered to the council at Tyana the document brought from Rome which is in my hands, and contains the same creed.

[244:59] They forgot their own address, when they came forward and bewailed the deceit by which they had been tricked into giving their adhesion to the document drawn up by the faction of Eudoxius, and so bethought them of the defence for that error, that they should go to Rome and there accept the creed of the Fathers, that so they might make amends, for the mischief they had done the Church by their agreement in evil, by their introduction of something better.

[244:60] Now the very men who undertook long journeys for the faith's sake, and made all these fine speeches, are reviling me for walking craftily, and for playing the plotter under the cloke of love.

[244:61] It is plain from the Letter, now being carried about, that they have condemned the faith of Nicaea.

[244:62] They saw Cyzicus, and came home with another creed.

[244:63] 6.

[244:64] But why say anything of mere verbal inconsistency? The practical proofs of their change of position afforded by their conduct are far stronger.

[244:65] They refused to yield to the sentence of fifty bishops passed against them.

[244:66] They declined to resign the government of their Churches although the number of bishops assenting to the decree for their deposition was so many, on the alleged ground that they were not partakers of the Holy Ghost, and were not governing their Churches by the grace of God, but had clutched their dignity by the aid of human power, and through lust of vain glory.

[244:67] Now they are for receiving the men consecrated by these same persons as bishops.

[244:68] I should like you to ask them in my stead, (although they despise all mankind, as bereft of eyes, ears, and common sense), to perceive the inconsistency of their conduct, what sentiments they do really entertain in their own hearts.

[244:69] How can there be two bishops, one deposed by Euippius, and the other consecrated by him? Both are the actions of the same man.

[244:70] Had he not been endowed with the grace bestowed upon Jeremiah to pull down and build again, to root out and to plant, he certainly would not have rooted the one out and planted the other.

[244:71] Grant him the one and you must grant him the other.

[244:72] Their one object, as it seems, is everywhere to look to their own advantage, and to regard every one who acts in accordance with their own wishes as a friend, while they treat any one who opposes them as an enemy, and spare no calumny to run him down.

[244:73] 7.

[244:74] What measures are they now taking against the Church? For the shiftiness of their originators, shocking; for the apathy of all who are affected by them, pitiable.

[244:75] By a respectable commission the children and grandchildren of Euippius have been summoned from distant regions to Sebasteia, and to them the people have been entrusted.

[244:76] They have taken possession of the altar.

[244:77] They have been made the leaven of that Church.

[244:78] I am persecuted by them as a Homoousiast.

[244:79] Eustathius, who brought the Homoousion in the script from Rome to Tyana, although he was not able to get admitted into their much to be coveted communion, either because they feared, or respected the authority of, the large number of persons who had agreed in condemning him, is now in intimate alliance with them.

[244:80] I only hope that I may never have time enough on my hands to tell of all their doings—who were gathered together, how each one had been ordained, and from what kind of earlier life each arrived at his present dignity.

[244:81] I have been taught to pray "that my mouth may not utter the works of the men".

[244:82] If you enquire you will learn these things for yourself, and, if they are hidden from you, they will not assuredly continue hidden from the judges.

[244:83] 8.

[244:84] I will not, however, omit to tell you, my dear friend, in what a state I have been.

[244:85] Last year I suffered from a very violent fever, and came near to the gates of death.

[244:86] When, by God's mercy, I was restored, I was distressed at coming back to life, as I bethought me of all the troubles before me.

[244:87] I considered with myself for what reason, hidden in the depths of the wisdom of God, yet further days of life in the flesh had been allowed me.

[244:88] But when I heard of these matters I concluded that the Lord wished me to see the Churches at rest after the storm which they had previously suffered from the alienation of the men in whom, on account of their fictitious gravity of character, every confidence had been placed.

[244:89] Or peradventure the Lord designed to invigorate my soul, and to render it more vigilant for the future, to the end that, instead of giving heed to men, it might be made perfect through those precepts of the Gospel which do not share in the changes and chances of human seasons and circumstances, but abide for ever the same, as they were uttered by the blessed lips that cannot lie.

[244:90] 9.

[244:91] Men are like clouds, shifting hither and thither in the sky with the change of the winds.

[244:92] And of all men who have ever come within my experience these of whom I am speaking are the most unstable.

[244:93] As to the other business of life, those who have lived with them may give evidence; but as to what is within my own knowledge, their inconsistency as regards the faith, I do not know that I have ever myself observed it or heard from any one else, of anything like it.

[244:94] Originally they were followers of Arius; then they went over to Hermogenes, who was diametrically opposed to the errors of Arius, as is evinced by the Creed originally recited by him at Nicaea.

[244:95] Hermogenes, fell asleep, and then they went over to Eusebius, the Coryphaeus, as we know on personal evidence, of the Arian ring.

[244:96] Leaving this, for whatever reasons, they came home again, and once more concealed their Arian sentiments.

[244:97] After reaching the episcopate, to pass by what occurred in the interval, how many creeds did they put forth? One at Ancyra; another at Seleucia; another at Constantinople, the famous one; another at Lampsacus, then that of Nike in Thrace; and now again the creed of Cyzicus.

[244:98] Of this last I know nothing, except that I am told that they have suppressed the homoousion, and are supporting the like in essence, while they subscribe with Eunomius the blasphemies against the Holy Spirit.

[244:99] Although all of the creeds which I have enumerated may not be opposed to one another, yet they alike exhibit the inconsistency of the men's minds, from their never standing by the same words.

[244:100] I have said nothing as to countless other points, but this that I do say is true.

[244:101] Now that they have gone over to you, I beg you to write back by the same man, I mean our fellow presbyter Strategius, whether you have remained in the same mind towards me, or whether you have been alienated in consequence of your meeting them.

[244:102] For it was not likely that they would be silent, nor that you yourself, after writing to me as you have, would not use free speaking to them too.

[244:103] If you remain in communion with me, it is well; it is what I would most earnestly pray for.

[244:104] If they have drawn you over to them, it is sad.

[244:105] How should separation from such a brother not be sad? If in nothing else, at least in bearing losses like this, we have been considerably tried at their hands.

[245:1] Letter CCXLV.

[245:2] To Theophilus the Bishop.

[245:3] It is some time since I received your letter, but I waited to be able to reply by some fit person; that so the bearer of my answer might supply whatever might be wanting in it.

[245:4] Now there has arrived our much beloved and very reverend brother Strategius, and I have judged it well to make use of his services, both as knowing my mind and able to convey news of me with due propriety and reverence.

[245:5] Know, therefore, my beloved and honoured friend, that I highly value my affection for you, and am not conscious so far as the disposition of my heart goes, of having at any time failed in it, although I have had many serious causes of reasonable complaint.

[245:6] But I have decided to weigh the good against the bad, as in a balance, and to add my own mind where the better inclines.

[245:7] Now changes have been made by those who should least of all have allowed anything of the kind.

[245:8] Pardon me, therefore, for I have not changed my mind, if I have shifted any side, or rather I should say, I shall still be on the same side, but there are others who are continually changing it, and are now openly deserting to the foe.

[245:9] You yourself know what a value I put on their communion, so long as they were of the sound party.

[245:10] If now I refuse to follow these, and shun all who think with them, I ought fairly to be forgiven.

[245:11] I put truth and my own salvation before everything.

[246:1] Letter CCXLVI.

[246:2] To the Nicopolitans.

[246:3] I am filled with distress at seeing evil on the high road to success, while you, my reverend friends, are faint and failing under continuous calamity.

[246:4] But when again I bethink me of the mighty hand of God, and reflect that He knows how to raise up them that are broken down, to love the just, to crush the proud and to put down the mighty from their seats, then again my heart grows lighter by hope, and I know that through your prayers the calm that the Lord will show us will come soon.

[246:5] Only grow not weary in prayer, but in the present emergency strive to give to all a plain example by deed of whatever you teach by word.

[247:1] Letter CCXLVII.

[247:2] To the Nicopolitans.

[247:3] When I had read the letter of your holinesses, how did I not groan and lament that I had heard of these further troubles, of blows and insults inflicted on yourselves, of destruction of homes, devastation of the city, ruin of your whole country, persecution of the Church, banishment; of priests, invasion of wolves, and scattering of flocks.

[247:4] But I have looked to the Lord in heaven, and have ceased to groan and weep, because I am perfectly well assured, as I hope you know too, that help will speedily come and that you will not be for ever forsaken.

[247:5] What we have suffered, we have suffered for our sins.

[247:6] But our loving Lord will show us His own aid for the sake of His love and pity for the Churches.

[247:7] Nevertheless, I have not omitted to beseech men in authority in person.

[247:8] I have written to those at court, who love us, that the wrath of our ravening enemy may be stayed.

[247:9] I think, moreover, that from many quarters condemnation may fall upon his head, unless indeed these troublous times allow our public men no leisure for these matters.

[248:1] Letter CCXLVIII.

[248:2] To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

[248:3] So far as my own wishes are concerned I am grieved at living at such a distance from your reverence.

[248:4] But, as regards the peace of your own life, I thank the Lord Who has kept you out of this conflagration which has specially ravaged my diocese.

[248:5] For the just Judge has sent me, in accordance with my works, a messenger of Satan, who is buffeting me severely enough, and is vigorously defending the heresy.

[248:6] Indeed to such a pitch has he carried the war against us, that he does not shrink even from shedding the blood of those who trust in God.

[248:7] You cannot fail to have heard that a man of the name of Asclepius, because he would not consent to communion with Doeg, has died under the blows inflicted on him by them, or rather, by their blows has been translated into life.

[248:8] You may suppose that the rest of their doings are of a piece with this; the persecutions of presbyters and teachers, and all that might be expected to be done by men abusing the imperial authority at their own caprice.

[248:9] But, in answer to your prayers, the Lord will give us release from these things, and patience to bear the weight of our trials worthily of our hope in Him.

[248:10] Pray write frequently to me of all that concerns yourself.

[248:11] If you find any one who can be trusted to carry you the book that I have finished, be so kind as to send for it, that so, when I have been cheered by your approval, I may send it on to others also.

[248:12] By the grace of the Holy One may you be granted to me and to the Church of the Lord in good health rejoicing in the Lord, and praying for me.

[249:1] Letter CCXLIX.

[249:2] Without address.

[249:3] Commendatory.

[249:4] I congratulate this my brother, in being delivered from our troubles here and in approaching your reverence.

[249:5] In choosing a good life with them that fear the Lord he has chosen a good provision for the life to come.

[249:6] I commend him to your excellency and by him I beseech you to pray for my wretched life, to the end that I may be delivered from these trials and begin to serve the Lord according to the Gospel.

[250:1] Letter CCL.

[250:2] To Patrophilus, bishop of aegae.

[250:3] There has been some delay in my receiving your answer to my former letter; but it has reached me through the well-beloved Strategius, and I have given thanks to the Lord for your continuance in your love to me.

[250:4] What you have now been kind enough to write on the same subject proves your good intentions, for you think as you ought, and you counsel me to my gain.

[250:5] But I see that my words will be extending too far, if I am to reply to everything written to me by your excellency.

[250:6] I therefore say no more than this, that, if the blessing of peace goes no further than the mere name of peace, it is ridiculous to go on picking out here one and there another, and allow them alone a share in the boon, while others beyond number are excluded from it.

[250:7] But if agreement with mischievous men, under the appearance of peace, really does the harm an enemy might do to all who consent to it, then only consider who those men are who have been admitted to their companionship, who have conceived an unrighteous hatred against me; who but men of the faction not in communion with me.

[250:8] There is no need now for me to mention them by name.

[250:9] They have been invited by them to Sebasteia; they have assumed the charge of the Church; they have performed service at the altar: they have given of their own bread to all the people, being proclaimed bishops by the clergy there, and escorted through all the district as saints and in communion.

[250:10] If one must adopt the faction of these men, it is absurd to begin at the extremities, and not rather to hold intercourse with those that are their heads.

[250:11] If then we are to count heretic and shun no one at all, why, tell me, do you separate yourself from the communion of certain persons? But if any are to be shunned, let me be told by these people who are so logically consistent in everything, to what party those belong whom they have invited over from Galatia to join them? If such things seem grievous to you, charge the separation on those who are responsible for it.

[250:12] If you judge them to be of no importance, forgive me for declining to be of the leaven of the teachers of wrong doctrine.

[250:13] Wherefore, if you will, have no more to do with those specious arguments, but with all openness confute them that do not walk aright in the truth of the Gospel.

[251:1] Letter CCLI.

[251:2] To the people of Evaesae.

[251:3] 1.

[251:4] My occupations are very numerous, and my mind is full of many anxious cares, but I have never forgotten you, my dear friends, ever praying my God for your constancy in the faith, wherein ye stand and have your boasting in the hope of the glory of God.

[251:5] Truly nowadays it is hard to find, and extraordinary to see, a Church pure, unharmed by the troubles of the times, and preserving the apostolic doctrine in all its integrity and completeness.

[251:6] Such is your Church shewn at this present time by Him who in every generation makes manifest them that are worthy of His calling.

[251:7] May the Lord grant to you the blessings of Jerusalem which is above, in return for your flinging back at the heads of the liars their slanders against me, and your refusal to allow them entry into your hearts.

[251:8] I know, and am persuaded in the Lord, that "your reward is great in heaven," even on account of this very conduct.

[251:9] For you have wisely concluded among yourselves, as indeed is the truth, that the men who are "rewarding me evil for good, and hatred for my love," are accusing me now for the very same points which they are found to have themselves confessed and subscribed.

[251:10] 2.

[251:11] Their presenting you with their own signatures for an accusation against me is not the only contradiction into which they have fallen.

[251:12] They were unanimously deposed by the bishops assembled at Constantinople.

[251:13] They refused to accept this deposition and appealed to a synod of impious men, refusing to admit the episcopacy of their judges, in order not to accept the sentence passed upon them.

[251:14] The reason alleged for their non-recognition was their being leaders of wicked heresy.

[251:15] All this happened nearly seventeen years ago.

[251:16] The principal men of those who deposed them were Eudoxius, Euippius, George, Acacius, and others unknown to you.

[251:17] The present tyrants of the churches are their successors, some ordained to fill their places, and others actually promoted by them.

[251:18] 3.

[251:19] Now let those who charge me with unsound doctrine tell me in what way the men whose deposition they refused to accept were heretical.

[251:20] Let them tell me in what way those promoted by them, and holding the same views as their fathers, are orthodox.

[251:21] If Euippius was orthodox, how can Eustathius, whom he deposed, be other than a layman? If Euippius was a heretic, how can any one ordained by him be in communion with Eustathius now? But all this conduct, this trying to accuse men and set them up again, is child's play, got up against the Churches of God, for their own gain.

[251:22] When Eustathius was travelling through Paphlagonia, he overthrew the altars of Basilides of Paphlagonia, and used to perform divine service on his own tables.

[251:23] Now he is begging Basilides to be admitted to communion.

[251:24] He refused to communicate with our reverend brother Elpidius, because of his alliance with the Amasenes; and now he comes as a suppliant to the Amasenes, petitioning for alliance with them.

[251:25] Even ye yourselves know how shocking were his public utterances against Euippius: now he glorifies the holders of Euippius's opinions for their orthodoxy, if only they will cooperate in promoting his restitution.

[251:26] And I am all the while being calumniated, not because I am doing any wrong, but because they have imagined that they will thus be recommended to the party at Antioch.

[251:27] The character of those whom they sent for last year from Galatia, as being likely by their means to recover the free exercise of their episcopal powers, is only too well known to all who have lived even for a short time with them.

[251:28] I pray that the Lord may never allow me leisure to recount all their proceedings.

[251:29] I will only say that they have passed through the whole country, with the honour and attendance of bishops, escorted by their most honourable bodyguard and sympathizers; and have made a grand entry into the city, and held an assembly with all authority.

[251:30] The people have been given over to them.

[251:31] The altar has been given over to them.

[251:32] How they went to Nicopolis, and could do nothing there of all that they had promised, and how they came, and what appearance they presented on their return, is known to those who were on the spot.

[251:33] They are obviously taking every single step for their own gain and profit.

[251:34] If they say that they have repented, let them shew their repentance in writing; let them anathematize the Creed of Constantinople; let them separate from the heretics; and let them no longer trick the simple-minded.

[251:35] So much for them and theirs.

[251:36] 4.

[251:37] I, however, brethren beloved, small and insignificant as I am, but remaining ever by God's grace the same, have never changed with the changes of the world.

[251:38] My creed has not varied at Seleucia, at Constantinople, at Zela, at Lampsacus, and at Rome.

[251:39] My present creed is not different from the former; it has remained ever one and the same.

[251:40] As we received from the Lord, so are we baptized; as we are baptized, so we make profession of our faith; as we make profession of our faith, so do we offer our doxology, not separating the Holy Ghost from Father and Son, nor preferring Him in honour to the Father, or asserting Him to be prior to the Son, as blasphemers' tongues invent.

[251:41] Who could be so rash as to reject the Lord's commandment, and boldly devise an order of his own for the Names? But I do not call the Spirit, Who is ranked with Father and Son, a creature.

[251:42] I do not dare to call slavish that which is royal.

[251:43] And I beseech you to remember the threat uttered by the Lord in the words, "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men, neither in this world, neither in the world to come".

[251:44] Keep yourselves from dangerous teaching against the Spirit.

[251:45] "Stand fast in the faith".

[251:46] Look over all the world, and see how small the part is which is unsound.

[251:47] All the rest of the Church which has received the Gospel.

[251:48] from one end of the world to the other, abides in this sound and unperverted doctrine.

[251:49] From their communion I pray that I may never fall, and I pray that I may have part and lot with you in the righteous day of our Lord Jesus Christ, when He shall come to give to every one according to his conduct.

[252:1] Letter CCLII.

[252:2] To the bishops of the Pontic Diocese.

[252:3] The honours of martyrs ought to be very eagerly coveted by all who rest their hopes on the Lord, and more especially by you who seek after virtue.

[252:4] By your disposition towards the great and good among your fellow servants you are shewing your affection to our common Lord.

[252:5] Moreover, a special reason for this is to be found in the tie, as it were, of blood, which binds the life of exact discipline to those who have been made perfect through endurance.

[252:6] Since then Eupsychius and Damas and their company are most illustrious among martyrs, and their memory is yearly kept in our city and all the neighbourhood, the Church, calling on you by my voice, reminds you to keep up your ancient custom of paying a visit.

[252:7] A great and good work lies before you among the people, who desire to be edified by you, and are anxious for the reward dependent on the honour paid to the martyrs.

[252:8] Receive, therefore, my supplications, and consent of your kindness to give at the cost of small trouble to yourselves a great boon to me.

[253:1] Letter CCLIII.

[253:2] To the presbyters of Antioch.

[253:3] The anxious care which you have for the Churches of God will to some extent be assuaged by our very dear and very reverend brother Sanctissimus the presbyter, when he has told you of the love and kindness felt for us by all the West.

[253:4] But, on the other hand, it will be roused afresh and made yet keener, when he has told you in person what zeal is demanded by the present position of affairs.

[253:5] All other authorities have told us, as it were, by halves, the minds of men in the West, and the condition of things there.

[253:6] He is very competent to understand men's minds, and to make exact enquiry into the condition of affairs, and he will tell you everything and will guide your good will through the whole business.

[253:7] You have matter before you appropriate to the excellent will which you have always shewn in your anxiety on behalf of the Churches of God.

[254:1] Letter CCLIV.

[254:2] To Pelagius, bishop of the Syrian Laodicea.

[254:3] May the Lord grant me once again in person to behold your true piety and to supply in actual intercourse all that is wanting in my letter.

[254:4] I am behindhand in beginning to write and must needs make many excuses.

[254:5] But we have with us the well beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter.

[254:6] He will tell you everything, both our news and the news of the West.

[254:7] You will be cheered by what you hear; but when he tells you of the troubles in which we are involved he will perhaps add some distress and anxiety to that which already besets your kindly soul.

[254:8] Yet it is not to no purpose that affliction should be felt by you, able as you are to move the Lord.

[254:9] Your anxiety will turn to our gain, and I know that we shall receive succour from God as long as we have the aid of your prayers.

[254:10] Pray, too, with me for release from my anxieties, and ask for some increase in my bodily strength; then the Lord will prosper me on my way to the fulfilment of my desires and to a sight of your excellency.

[255:1] Letter CCLV.

[255:2] To Vitus, bishop of Charrae.

[255:3] Would that it were possible for me to write to your reverence every day! For ever since I have had experience of your affection I have had great desire to converse with you, or, if this be impossible, at least to communicate with you by letter, that I may tell you my own news and learn in what state you are.

[255:4] Yet we have not what we wish but what the Lord gives, and this we ought to receive with gratitude.

[255:5] I have therefore thanked the holy God for giving me an opportunity for writing to your reverence on the arrival of our very well beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter.

[255:6] He has had considerable trouble in accomplishing his journey, and will tell you with accuracy all that he has learnt in the West.

[255:7] For all these things we ought to thank the Lord and to beseech Him to give us too the same peace and that we may freely receive one another.

[255:8] Receive all the brethren in Christ in my name.

[256:1] Letter CCLVI.

[256:2] To the very well beloved and reverend brethren the presbyters Acacius, Aetius, Paulus, and Silvanus; the deacons Silvinus and Lucius, and the rest of the brethren the monks, Basil, the bishop.

[256:3] News has reached me of the severe persecution carried on against you, and how directly after Easter the men who fast for strife and debate attacked your homes, and gave your labours to the flames, preparing for you indeed a house in the heavens, not made with hands, but for themselves laying up in store the fire which they had used to your hurt.

[256:4] I no sooner heard of this than I groaned over what had happened; pitying not you, my brethren, (God forbid!) but the men who are so sunk in wickedness as to carry their evil deeds to such an extent.

[256:5] I expected you all to hurry at once to the refuge prepared for you in my humble self; and I hoped that the Lord would give me refreshment in the midst of my continual troubles in embracing you, and in receiving on this inactive body of mine the noble sweat which you are dropping for the truth's sake, and so having some share in the prizes laid up for you by the Judge of truth.

[256:6] But this did not enter into your minds, and you did not even expect any relief at my hands.

[256:7] I was therefore at least anxious to find frequent opportunities of writing to you, to the end that like those who cheer on combatants in the arena, I might myself by letter give you some encouragement in your good fight.

[256:8] For two reasons, however, I have not found this easy.

[256:9] In the first place, I did not know where you were residing.

[256:10] And, secondly, but few of our people travel in your direction.

[256:11] Now the Lord has brought us the very well beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter.

[256:12] By him I am able to salute you, and I beseech you to pray for me, rejoicing and exulting that your reward is great in heaven, and that you have freedom with the Lord to cease not day and night calling on Him to put an end to this storm of the Churches; to grant the shepherds to their flocks, and that the Church may return to her proper dignity.

[256:13] I am persuaded that if a voice be found to move our good God, He will not make His mercy afar off, but will now "with the temptation make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it".

[256:14] Salute all the brethren in Christ in any name.

[257:1] Letter CCLVII.

[257:2] To the monks harassed by the Arians.

[257:3] 1.

[257:4] I have thought it only right to announce to you by letter how I said to myself, when I heard of the trials brought upon you by the enemies of God, that in a time reckoned a time of peace you have won for yourselves the blessings promised to all who suffer persecution for the sake of the name of Christ.

[257:5] In my judgment the war that is waged against us by our fellow countrymen is the hardest to bear, because against open and declared enemies it is easy to defend ourselves, while we are necessarily at the mercy of those who are associated with us, and are thus exposed to continual danger.

[257:6] This has been your case.

[257:7] Our fathers were persecuted, but by idolaters their substance was plundered, their houses were overthrown, they themselves were driven into exile, by our open enemies, for Christ's name's sake.

[257:8] The persecutors who have lately appeared, hate us no less than they, but, to the deceiving of many, they put forward the name of Christ, that the persecuted may be robbed of all comfort from its confession, because the majority of simpler folk, while admitting that we are being wronged, are unwilling to reckon our death for the truth's sake to be martyrdom.

[257:9] I am therefore persuaded that the reward in store for you from the righteous Judge is yet greater than that bestowed on those former martyrs.

[257:10] They indeed both had the public praise of men, and received the reward of God; to you, though your good deeds are not less, no honours are given by the people.

[257:11] It is only fair that the requital in store for you in the world to come should be far greater.

[257:12] 2.

[257:13] I exhort you, therefore, not to faint in your afflictions, but to be revived by God's love, and to add daily to your zeal, knowing that in you ought to be preserved that remnant of true religion which the Lord will find when He cometh on the earth.

[257:14] Even if bishops are driven from their Churches, be not dismayed.

[257:15] If traitors have arisen from among the very clergy themselves, let not this undermine your confidence in God.

[257:16] We are saved not by names, but by mind and purpose, and genuine love toward our Creator.

[257:17] Bethink you how in the attack against our Lord, high priests and scribes and elders devised the plot, and how few of the people were found really receiving the word.

[257:18] Remember that it is not the multitude who are being saved, but the elect of God.

[257:19] Be not then affrighted at the great multitude of the people who are carried hither and thither by winds like the waters of the sea.

[257:20] If but one be saved, like Lot at Sodom, he ought to abide in right judgment, keeping his hope in Christ unshaken, for the Lord will not forsake His holy ones.

[257:21] Salute all the brethren in Christ from me.

[257:22] Pray earnestly for my miserable soul.

[258:1] Letter CCLVIII.

[258:2] To Epiphanius the bishop.

[258:3] 1.

[258:4] It has long been expected that, in accordance with the prediction of our Lord, because of iniquity abounding, the love of the majority would wax cold.

[258:5] Now experience has confirmed this expectation.

[258:6] But though this condition of things has already obtained among us here, it seems to be contradicted by the letter brought from your holiness.

[258:7] For verily it is no mere ordinary proof of love, first that you should remember an unworthy and insignificant person like myself; and secondly, that you should send to visit me brethren who are fit and proper ministers of a correspondence of peace.

[258:8] For now, when every man is viewing every one else with suspicion, no spectacle is rarer than that which you are presenting.

[258:9] Nowhere is pity to be seen; nowhere sympathy; nowhere a brotherly tear for a brother in distress.

[258:10] Not persecutions for the truth's sake, not Churches with all their people in tears; not this great tale of troubles closing round us, are enough to stir us to anxiety for the welfare of one another.

[258:11] We jump on them that are fallen; we scratch and tear at wounded places; we who are supposed to agree with one another launch the curses that are uttered by the heretics; men who are in agreement on the most important matters are wholly severed from one another on some one single point.

[258:12] How, then, can I do otherwise than admire him who in such circumstances shews that his love to his neighbour is pure and guileless, and, though separated from me by so great a distance of sea and land, gives my soul all the care he can?  2.

[258:13] I have been specially struck with admiration at your having been distressed even by the dispute of the monks on the Mount of Olives, and at your expressing a wish that some means might be found of reconciling them to one another.

[258:14] I have further been glad to hear that you have not been unaware of the unfortunate steps, taken by certain persons, which have caused disturbance among the brethren, and that you have keenly interested yourself even in these matters.

[258:15] But I have deemed it hardly worthy of your wisdom that you should entrust the rectification of matters of such importance to me: for I am not guided by the grace of God, because of my living in sin; I have no power of eloquence, because I have cheerfully withdrawn from vain studies; and I am not yet sufficiently versed in the doctrines of the truth.

[258:16] I have therefore already written to my beloved brethren at the Mount of Olives, our own Palladius, and Innocent the Italian, in answer to their letters to me, that it is impossible for me to make even the slightest addition to the Nicene Creed, except the ascription of Glory to the Holy Ghost, because our Fathers treated this point cursorily, no question having at that time arisen concerning the Spirit.

[258:17] As to the additions it is proposed to make to that Creed, concerning the incarnation of our Lord, I have neither tested nor accepted them, as being beyond my comprehension.

[258:18] I know well that, if once we begin to interfere with the simplicity of the Creed, we shall embark on interminable discussion, contradiction ever leading us on and on, and shall but disturb the souls of simpler folk by the introduction of new phrases.

[258:19] 3.

[258:20] As to the Church at Antioch (I mean that which is in agreement in the same doctrine), may the Lord grant that one day we may see it united.

[258:21] It is in peril of being specially open to the attacks of the enemy, who is angry with it because there the name of Christian first obtained.

[258:22] There heresy is divided against orthodoxy, and orthodoxy is divided against herself.

[258:23] My position, however, is this.

[258:24] The right reverend bishop Meletius was the first to speak boldly for the truth, and fought that good fight in the days of Constantine.

[258:25] Therefore my Church has felt strong affection towards him, for the sake of that brave and firm stand, and has held communion with him.

[258:26] I, therefore, by God's grace, have held him to be in communion up to this time; and, if God will, I shall continue to do so.

[258:27] Moreover the very blessed Pope Athanasius came from Alexandria, and was most anxious that communion should be established between Meletius and himself; but by the malice of counsellors their conjunction was put off to another season.

[258:28] Would that this had not been so! I have never accepted communion with any one of those who have since been introduced into the see, not because I count them unworthy, but because I see no ground for the condemnation of Meletius.

[258:29] Nevertheless I have heard many things about the brethren, without giving heed to them, because the accused were not brought face to face with their accusers, according to that which is written, "Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?" I cannot therefore at present write to them, right honourable brother, and I ought not to be forced to do so.

[258:30] It will be becoming to your peaceful disposition not to cause union in one direction and disunion in another, but to restore the severed member to the original union.

[258:31] First, then, pray; next, to the utmost of your ability, exhort, that ambition may be driven from their hearts, and that reconciliation may be effected between them both to restore strength to the Church, and to destroy the rage of our foes.

[258:32] It has given great comfort to my soul that, in addition to your other right and accurate statements in theology, you should acknowledge the necessity of stating that the hypostases are three.

[258:33] Let the brethren at Antioch be instructed by you after this manner.

[258:34] Indeed I am confident that they have been so instructed; for I am sure you would never have accepted communion with them unless you had carefully made sure of this point in them.

[258:35] 4.

[258:36] The Magusaeans, as you were good enough to point out to me in your other letter, are here in considerable numbers, scattered all over the country, settlers having long ago been introduced into these parts from Babylon.

[258:37] Their manners are peculiar, as they do not mix with other men.

[258:38] It is quite impossible to converse with them, inasmuch as they have been made the prey of the devil to do his will.

[258:39] They have no books; no instructors in doctrine.

[258:40] They are brought up in senseless institutions, piety being handed down from father to son.

[258:41] In addition to the characteristics which are open to general observation, they object to the slaying of animals as defilement, and they cause the animals they want for their own use to be slaughtered by other people.

[258:42] They are wild after illicit marriages; they consider fire divine, and so on.

[258:43] No one hitherto has told me any fables about the descent of the Magi from Abraham: they name a certain Zarnuas as the founder of their race.

[258:44] I have nothing more to write to your excellency about them.

[259:1] Letter CCLIX.

[259:2] To the monks Palladius and Innocent.

[259:3] From your affection for me you ought to be able to conjecture my affection for you.

[259:4] I have always desired to be a herald of peace, and, when I fail in my object, I am grieved.

[259:5] How could it be otherwise? I cannot feel angry with any one for this reason, because I know that the blessing of peace has long ago been withdrawn from us.

[259:6] If the responsibility for division lies with others, may the Lord grant that those who cause dissension may cease to do so.

[259:7] I cannot even ask that your visits to me may be frequent.

[259:8] You have therefore no reason to excuse yourselves on this score.

[259:9] I am well aware that men who have embraced the life of labour, and always provide with their own hands the necessities of life, cannot be long away from home; but, wherever you are, remember me, and pray for me that no cause of disturbance may dwell in my heart, and that I may be at peace with myself and with God.

[260:1] Letter CCLX.

[260:2] To Optimus the bishop.

[260:3] 1.

[260:4] Under any circumstances I should have gladly seen the good lads, on account of both a steadiness of character beyond their years, and their near relationship to your excellency, which might have led me to expect something remarkable in them.

[260:5] And, when I saw them approaching me with your letter, my affection towards them was doubled.

[260:6] But now that I have read the letter, now that I have seen all the anxious care for the Church that there is in it, and the evidence it affords of your zeal in reading the divine Scriptures, I thank the Lord.

[260:7] And I invoke blessings on those who brought me such a letter, and, even before them, on the writer himself.

[260:8] 2.

[260:9] You have asked for a solution of that famous passage which is everywhere interpreted in different senses, "Whosoever slayeth Cain will exact vengeance for seven sins".

[260:10] Your question shews that you have yourself carefully observed the charge of Paul to Timothy, for you are obviously attentive to your reading.

[260:11] You have moreover roused me, old man that I am, dull alike from age and bodily infirmity, and from the many afflictions which have been stirred up round about me and have weighed down my life.

[260:12] Fervent in spirit as you are yourself, you are rousing me, now benumbed like a beast in his den, to some little wakefulness and vital energy.

[260:13] The passage in question may be interpreted simply and may also receive an elaborate explanation.

[260:14] The simpler, and one that may occur to any one off hand, is this: that Cain ought to suffer sevenfold punishment for his sins.

[260:15] For it is not the part of a righteous judge to define requital on the principle of like for like, but the originator of evil must pay his debt with addition, if he is to be made better by punishment and render other men wiser by his example.

[260:16] Therefore, since it is ordained that Cain pay the penalty of his sin sevenfold, he who kills him, it is said, will discharge the sentence pronounced against him by the divine judgment.

[260:17] This is the sense that suggests itself to us on our first reading the passage.

[260:18] 3.

[260:19] But readers, gifted with greater curiosity, are naturally inclined to probe into the question further.

[260:20] How, they ask, can justice be satisfied seven times? And what are the vengeances? Are they for seven sins committed? Or is the sin committed once and are there seven punishments for the one sin? Scripture continually assigns seven as the number of the remission of sins.

[260:21] "How often," it is asked, "shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?" (It is Peter who is speaking to the Lord.

[260:22] ) "Till seven times?" Then comes the Lord's answer, "I say not unto thee, until seven times, but, until seventy times seven".

[260:23] Our Lord did not vary the number, but multiplied the seven, and so fixed the limit of the forgiveness.

[260:24] After seven years the Hebrew used to be freed from slavery.

[260:25] Seven weeks of years used in old times to make the famous jubilee, in which the land rested, debts were remitted, slaves were set free, and, as it were, a new life began over again, the old life from age to age being in a sense completed at the number seven.

[260:26] These things are types of this present life, which revolves in seven days and passes by, wherein punishments of slighter sins are inflicted, according to the loving care of our good Lord, to save us from being delivered to punishment in the age that has no end.

[260:27] The expression seven times is therefore introduced because of its connexion with this present world for men who love this world ought specially to be punished in the things for the sake of which they have chosen to live wicked lives.

[260:28] If you understand the vengeances to be for the sins committed by Cain, you will find those sins to be seven.

[260:29] Or if you understand them to mean the sentence passed on him by the Judge, you will not go far wrong.

[260:30] To take the crimes of Cain: the first sin is envy at the preference of Abel; the second is guile, whereby he said to his brother, "Let us go into the field:" the third is murder, a further wickedness: the fourth, fratricide, a still greater iniquity: the fifth that he committed the first murder, and set a bad example to mankind: the sixth wrong in that he grieved his parents: the seventh, his lie to God; for when he was asked, "Where is Abel thy brother?" he replied, "I know not".

[260:31] Seven sins were therefore avenged in the destruction of Cain.

[260:32] For when the Lord said, "Cursed is the earth which has opened to receive the blood of thy brother," and "groaning and trembling shall there be on the earth," Cain said, "If thou castest me out to-day from the earth, then from thy face shall I be hid, and groaning and trembling shall I lie upon the earth, and every one that findeth me shall slay me".

[260:33] It is in answer to this that the Lord says, "Whosoever slayeth Cain will discharge seven vengeances".

[260:34] Cain supposed that he would be an easy prey to every one, because of there being no safety for him in the earth (for the earth was cursed for his sake), and of his being deprived of the succour of God, Who was angry with him for the murder, and so of there being no help for him either from earth or from heaven.

[260:35] Therefore he said, "It shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me".

[260:36] Scripture proves his error in the words, "Not so;" i-e: thou shalt not be slain.

[260:37] For to men suffering punishment, death is a gain, because it brings relief from their pain.

[260:38] But thy life shall be prolonged, that thy punishment may be made commensurate with thy sins.

[260:39] Since then the word ἐκδικούμενον may be understood in two senses; both the sin for which vengeance was taken, and the manner of the punishment, let us now examine whether the criminal suffered a sevenfold torment.

[260:40] 4.

[260:41] The seven sins of Cain have been enumerated in what has been already said.

[260:42] Now I ask if the punishments inflicted on him were seven, and I state as follows.

[260:43] The Lord enquired 'Where is Abel thy brother?' not because he wished for information, but in order to give Cain an opportunity for repentance, as is proved by the words themselves, for on his denial the Lord immediately convicts him saying, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me".

[260:44] So the enquiry, "Where is Abel thy brother?" was not made with a view to God's information, but to give Cain an opportunity of perceiving his sin.

[260:45] But for God's having visited him he might have pleaded that he was left alone and had no opportunity given him for repentance.

[260:46] Now the physician appeared that the patient might flee to him for help.

[260:47] Cain, however, not only fails to hide his sore, but makes another one in adding the lie to the murder.

[260:48] "I know not.

[260:49] Am I my brother's keeper?" Now from this point begin to reckon the punishments.

[260:50] "Cursed is the ground for thy sake," one punishment.

[260:51] "Thou shalt till the ground".

[260:52] This is the second punishment.

[260:53] Some secret necessity was imposed upon him forcing him to the tillage of the earth, so that it should never be permitted him to take rest when he might wish, but ever to suffer pain with the earth, his enemy, which, by polluting it with his brother's blood, he had made accursed.

[260:54] "Thou shalt till the ground".

[260:55] Terrible punishment, to live with those that hate one, to have for a companion an enemy, an implacable foe.

[260:56] "Thou shalt till the earth," that is, Thou shalt toil at the labours of the field, never resting, never released from thy work, day or night, bound down by secret necessity which is harder than any savage master, and continually urged on to labour.

[260:57] "And it shall not yield unto thee her strength".

[260:58] Although the ceaseless toil had some fruit, the labour itself were no little torture to one forced never to relax it.

[260:59] But the toil is ceaseless, and the labours at the earth are fruitless (for "she did not yield her strength") and this fruitlessness of labour is the third punishment.

[260:60] "Groaning and trembling shalt thou be on the earth".

[260:61] Here two more are added to the three; continual groaning, and tremblings of the body, the limbs being deprived of the steadiness that comes of strength.

[260:62] Cain had made a bad use of the strength of his body, and so its vigour was destroyed, and it tottered and shook, and it was hard for him to lift meat and drink to his mouth, for after his impious conduct, his wicked hand was no longer allowed to minister to his body's needs.

[260:63] Another punishment is that which Cain disclosed when he said, "Thou hast driven me out from the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid".

[260:64] What is the meaning of this driving out from the face of the earth? It means deprivation of the benefits which are derived from the earth.

[260:65] He was not transferred to another place, but he was made a stranger to all the good things of earth.

[260:66] "And from thy face shall I be hid".

[260:67] The heaviest punishment for men of good heart is alienation from God.

[260:68] "And it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me".

[260:69] He infers this from what has gone before.

[260:70] If I am cast out of the earth, and hidden from thy face, it remains for me to be slain of every one.

[260:71] What says the Lord? Not so.

[260:72] But he put a mark upon him.

[260:73] This is the seventh punishment, that the punishment should not be hid, but that by a plain sign proclamation should be made to all, that this is the first doer of unholy deeds.

[260:74] To all who reason rightly the heaviest of punishments is shame.

[260:75] We have learned this also in the case of the judgments, when "some" shall rise "to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt".

[260:76] 5.

[260:77] Your next question is of a kindred character, concerning the words of Lamech to his wives; "I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt: if Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold".

[260:78] Some suppose that Cain was slain by Lamech, and that he survived to this generation that he might suffer a longer punishment.

[260:79] But this is not the case.

[260:80] Lamech evidently committed two murders, from what he says himself, "I have slain a man and a young man," the man to his wounding, and the young man to his hurt.

[260:81] There is a difference between wounding and hurt.

[260:82] And there is a difference between a man and a young man.

[260:83] "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold".

[260:84] It is right that I should undergo four hundred and ninety punishments, if God's judgment on Cain was just, that his punishments should be seven.

[260:85] Cain had not learned to murder from another, and had never seen a murderer undergoing punishment.

[260:86] But I, who had before my eyes Cain groaning and trembling, and the mightiness of the wrath of God, was not made wiser by the example before me.

[260:87] Wherefore I deserve to suffer four hundred and ninety punishments.

[260:88] There are, however, some who have gone so far as the following explanation, which does not jar with the doctrine of the Church; from Cain to the flood, they say, seven generations passed by, and the punishment was brought on the whole earth, because sin was everywhere spread abroad.

[260:89] But the sin of Lamech requires for its cure not a Flood, but Him Who Himself takes away the sin of the world.

[260:90] Count the generations from Adam to the coming of Christ, and you will find, according to the genealogy of Luke, that the Lord was born in the seventy-seventh.

[260:91] Thus I have investigated this point to the best of my ability, though I have passed by matters therein that might be investigated, for fear of prolonging my observations beyond the limits of my letter.

[260:92] But for your intelligence little seeds are enough.

[260:93] "Give instruction," it is said, "to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser".

[260:94] "If a skilful man hear a wise word he will commend it, and add unto it".

[260:95] 6.

[260:96] About the words of Simeon to Mary, there is no obscurity or variety of interpretation.

[260:97] "And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother, Behold, this Child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (yea, a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed".

[260:98] Here I am astonished that, after passing by the previous words as requiring no explanation, you should enquire about the expression, "Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also".

[260:99] To me the question, how the same child can be for the fall and rising again, and what is the sign that shall be spoken against, does not seem less perplexing than the question how a sword shall pierce through Mary's heart.

[260:100] 7.

[260:101] My view is, that the Lord is for falling and rising again, not because some fall and others rise again, but because in us the worst falls and the better is set up.

[260:102] The advent of the Lord is destructive of our bodily affections and it rouses the proper qualities of the soul.

[260:103] As when Paul says, "When I am weak, then I am strong," the same man is weak and is strong, but he is weak in the flesh and strong in the spirit.

[260:104] Thus the Lord does not give to some occasions of falling and to others occasions of rising.

[260:105] Those who fall, fall from the station in which they once were, but it is plain that the faithless man never stands, but is always dragged along the ground with the serpent whom he follows.

[260:106] He has then nowhere to fall from, because he has already been cast down by his unbelief.

[260:107] Wherefore the first boon is, that he who stands in his sin should fall and die, and then should live in righteousness and rise, both of which graces our faith in Christ confers on us.

[260:108] Let the worse fall that the better may have opportunity to rise.

[260:109] If fornication fall not, chastity does not rise.

[260:110] Unless our unreason be crushed our reason will not come to perfection.

[260:111] In this sense he is for the fall and rising again of many.

[260:112] 8.

[260:113] For a sign that shall be spoken against.

[260:114] By a sign, we properly understand in Scripture a cross.

[260:115] Moses, it is said, set the serpent "upon a pole".

[260:116] That is upon a cross.

[260:117] Or else a sign is indicative of something strange and obscure seen by the simple but understood by the intelligent.

[260:118] There is no cessation of controversy about the Incarnation of the Lord; some asserting that he assumed a body, and others that his sojourn was bodiless; some that he had a passible body, and others that he fulfilled the bodily oeconomy by a kind of appearance.

[260:119] Some say that his body was earthly, some that it was heavenly; some that He pre-existed before the ages; some that He took His beginning from Mary.

[260:120] It is on this account that He is a sign that shall be spoken against.

[260:121] 9.

[260:122] By a sword is meant the word which tries and judges our thoughts, which pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of our thoughts.

[260:123] Now every soul in the hour of the Passion was subjected, as it were, to a kind of searching.

[260:124] According to the word of the Lord it is said, "All ye shall be offended because of me".

[260:125] Simeon therefore prophesies about Mary herself, that when standing by the cross, and beholding what is being done, and hearing the voices, after the witness of Gabriel, after her secret knowledge of the divine conception, after the great exhibition of miracles, she shall feel about her soul a mighty tempest.

[260:126] The Lord was bound to taste of death for every man—to become a propitiation for the world and to justify all men by His own blood.

[260:127] Even thou thyself, who hast been taught from on high the things concerning the Lord, shalt be reached by some doubt.

[260:128] This is the sword.

[260:129] "That the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed".

[260:130] He indicates that after the offence at the Cross of Christ a certain swift healing shall come from the Lord to the disciples and to Mary herself, confirming their heart in faith in Him.

[260:131] In the same way we saw Peter, after he had been offended, holding more firmly to his faith in Christ.

[260:132] What was human in him was proved unsound, that the power of the Lord might be shewn.

[261:1] Letter CCLXI.

[261:2] To the Sozopolitans.

[261:3] I have received the letter which you, right honourable brethren, have sent me concerning the circumstances in which you are placed.

[261:4] I thank the Lord that you have let me share in the anxiety you feel as to your attention to things needful and deserving of serious heed.

[261:5] But I was distressed to hear that over and above the disturbance brought on the Churches by the Arians, and the confusion caused by them in the definition of the faith, there has appeared among you yet another innovation, throwing the brotherhood into great dejection, because, as you have informed me, certain persons are uttering, in the hearing of the faithful, novel and unfamiliar doctrines which they allege to be deduced from the teaching of Scripture.

[261:6] You write that there are men among you who are trying to destroy the saving incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, and, so far as they can, are overthrowing the grace of the great mystery unrevealed from everlasting, but manifested in His own times, when the Lord, when He had gone through all things pertaining to the cure of the human race, bestowed on all of us the boon of His own sojourn among us.

[261:7] For He helped His own creation, first through the patriarchs, whose lives were set forth as examples and rules to all willing to follow the footsteps of the saints, and with zeal like theirs to reach the perfection of good works.

[261:8] Next for succour He gave the Law, ordaining it by angels in the hand of Moses; then the prophets, foretelling the salvation to come; judges, kings, and righteous men, doing great works, with a mighty hand.

[261:9] After all these in the last days He was Himself manifested ill the flesh, "made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons".

[261:10] 2.

[261:11] If, then, the sojourn of the Lord in flesh has never taken place, the Redeemer paid not the fine to death on our behalf, nor through Himself destroyed death's reign.

[261:12] For if what was reigned over by death was not that which was assumed by the Lord, death would not have ceased working his own ends, nor would the sufferings of the God-bearing flesh have been made our gain; He would not have killed sin in the flesh: we who had died in Adam should not have been made alive in Christ; the fallen to pieces would not have been framed again; the shattered would not have been set up again; that which by the serpent's trick had been estranged from God would never have been made once more His own.

[261:13] All these boons are undone by those that assert that it was with a heavenly body that the Lord came among us.

[261:14] And if the God-bearing flesh was not ordained to be assumed of the lump of Adam, what need was there of the Holy Virgin? But who has the hardihood now once again to renew by the help of sophistical arguments and, of course, by scriptural evidence, that old dogma of Valentinus, now long ago silenced? For this impious doctrine of the seeming is no novelty.

[261:15] It was started long ago by the feeble-minded Valentinus, who, after tearing off a few of the Apostle's statements, constructed for himself this impious fabrication, asserting that the Lord assumed the "form of a servant," and not the servant himself, and that He was made in the "likeness," but that actual manhood was not assumed by Him.

[261:16] Similar sentiments are expressed by these men who can only be pitied for bringing new troubles upon you.

[261:17] 3.

[261:18] As to the statement that human feelings are transmitted to the actual Godhead, it is one made by men who preserve no order in their thoughts, and are ignorant that there is a distinction between the feelings of flesh, of flesh endowed with soul, and of soul using a body.

[261:19] It is the property of flesh to undergo division, diminution, dissolution; of flesh endowed with soul to feel weariness, pain, hunger, thirst, and to be overcome by sleep; of soul using body to feel grief, heaviness, anxiety, and such like.

[261:20] Of these some are natural and necessary to every living creature; others come of evil will, and are superinduced because of life's lacking proper discipline and training for virtue.

[261:21] Hence it is evident that our Lord assumed the natural affections to establish His real incarnation, and not by way of semblance of incantation, and that all the affections derived from evil that besmirch the purity of our life, He rejected as unworthy of His unsullied Godhead.

[261:22] It is on this account that He is said to have been "made in the likeness of flesh of sin;" not, as these men hold, in likeness of flesh, but of flesh of sin.

[261:23] It follows that He took our flesh with its natural afflictions, but "did no sin".

[261:24] Just as the death which is in the flesh, transmitted to us through Adam, was swallowed up by the Godhead, so was the sin taken away by the righteousness which is in Christ Jesus, so that in the resurrection we receive back the flesh neither liable to death nor subject to sin.

[261:25] These, brethren, are the mysteries of the Church; these are the traditions of the Fathers.

[261:26] Every man who fears the Lord, and is awaiting God's judgment, I charge not to be carried away by various doctrines.

[261:27] If any one teaches a different doctrine, and refuses to accede to the sound words of the faith, rejecting the oracles of the Spirit, and making his own teaching of more authority than the lessons of the Gospels, of such an one beware.

[261:28] May the Lord grant that one day we may meet, so that all that my argument has let slip I may supply when we stand face to face! I have written little when there was much to say, for I did not like to go beyond my letter's bounds.

[261:29] At the same time I do not doubt that to all that fear the Lord a brief reminder is enough.

[262:1] Letter CCLXII.

[262:2] To the Monk Urbicius.

[262:3] 1.

[262:4] You have done well to write to me.

[262:5] You have shewn how great is the fruit of charity.

[262:6] Continue so to do.

[262:7] Do not think that, when you write to me, you need offer excuses.

[262:8] I recognise my own position, and I know that by nature every man is of equal honour with the rest.

[262:9] Whatever excellence there is in me is not of family, nor of superfluous wealth, nor of physical condition; it comes only of superiority in the fear of God.

[262:10] What, then, hinders you from fearing the Lord yet more, and so, in this respect, being greater than I am? Write often to me, and acquaint me with the condition of the brotherhood with you.

[262:11] Tell me what members of the Church in your parts are sound, that I may know to whom I ought to write, and in whom I may confide.

[262:12] I am told that there are some who are endeavouring to deprave the right doctrine of the Lord's incarnation by perverse opinions, and I therefore call upon them through you to hold off from those unreasonable views, which some are reported to me to hold.

[262:13] I mean that God Himself was turned into flesh; that He did not assume, through the Holy Mary, the nature of Adam, but, in His own proper Godhead, was changed into a material nature.

[262:14] 2.

[262:15] This absurd position can be easily confuted.

[262:16] The blasphemy is its own conviction, and I therefore think that, for one who fears the Lord, the mere reminder is enough.

[262:17] If He was turned, then He was changed.

[262:18] But far be it from me to say or think such a thing, when God has declared, "I am the Lord, I change not".

[262:19] Moreover, how could the benefit of the incarnation be conveyed to us, unless our body, joined to the Godhead, was made superior to the dominion of death? If He was changed, He no longer constituted a proper body, such as subsisted after the combination with it of the divine body.

[262:20] But how, if all the nature of the Only-begotten was changed, could the incomprehensible Godhead be circumscribed within the limit of the mass of a little body? I am sure that no one who is in his senses, and has the fear of God, is suffering from this unsoundness.

[262:21] But the report has reached me that some of your company are afflicted with this mental infirmity, and I have therefore thought it necessary, not to send you a mere formal greeting, but to include in my letter something which may even build up the souls of them that fear the Lord.

[262:22] I therefore urge that these errors receive ecclesiastical correction, and that you abstain from communion with the heretics.

[262:23] I know that we are deprived of our liberty in Christ by indifference on these points.

[263:1] Letter CCLXIII.

[263:2] To the Westerns.

[263:3] 1.

[263:4] May the Lord God, in Whom we have put our trust, give to each of you grace sufficient to enable you to realize your hope, in proportion to the joy wherewith you have filled my heart, both by the letter which you have sent me by the hands of the well-beloved fellow-presbyters, and by the sympathy which you have felt for me in my distress, like men who have put on bowels of mercy, as you have been described to me by the presbyters afore-mentioned.

[263:5] Although my wounds remain the same, nevertheless it does bring alleviation to me that I should have leeches at hand, able, should they find an opportunity, to apply rapid remedies to my hurts.

[263:6] Wherefore in return I salute you by our beloved friends, and exhort you, if the Lord puts it into your power to come to me, not to hesitate to visit me.

[263:7] For part of the greatest commandment is the visitation of the sick.

[263:8] But if the good God and wise Dispenser of our lives reserves this boon for another season, at all events write to me whatever it is proper for you to write for the consolation of the oppressed and the lifting up of those that are crushed down.

[263:9] Already the Church has suffered many severe blows, and great has been my affliction at them.

[263:10] Nowhere is there expectation of succour unless the Lord sends us a remedy by you who are his true servants.

[263:11] 2.

[263:12] The bold and shameless heresy of the Arians, after being publicly cut off from the body of the Church, still abides in its own error, and does not do us much harm because its impiety is notorious to all.

[263:13] Nevertheless men clad in sheep's clothing, and presenting a mild and amiable appearance, but within unsparingly ravaging Christ's flocks, find it easy to do hurt to the simpler ones, because they came out from us.

[263:14] It is these who are grievous and hard to guard against.

[263:15] It is these that we implore your diligence to denounce publicly to all the Churches of the East; to the end that they may either turn to the right way and join with us in genuine alliance, or, if they abide in their perversity, may keep their mischief to themselves alone, and be unable to communicate their own plague to their neighbours by unguarded communion.

[263:16] I am constrained to mention them by name, in order that you may yourselves recognise those who are stirring up disturbance here, and may make them known to our Churches.

[263:17] My own words are suspected by most men, as though I had an ill will towards them on account of some private quarrel.

[263:18] You, however, have all the more credit with the people, in proportion to the distance that separates your home from theirs, besides the fact that you are gifted with God's grace to help those who are distressed.

[263:19] If more of you concur in uttering the same opinions, it is clear that the number of those who have expressed them will make it impossible to oppose their acceptance.

[263:20] 3.

[263:21] One of those who have caused me great sorrow is Eustathius of Sebasteia in Lesser Armenia; formerly a disciple of Arius, and a follower of him at the time when he flourished in Alexandria, and concocted his infamous blasphemies against the Only-begotten, he was numbered among his most faithful disciples.

[263:22] On his return to his own country he submitted a confession of the sound faith to Hermogenes, the very blessed Bishop of Caesarea, who was on the point of condemning him for false doctrine.

[263:23] Under these circumstances he was ordained by Hermogenes, and, on the death of that bishop, hastened to Eusebius of Constantinople, who himself yielded to none in the energy of his support of the impious doctrine of Arius.

[263:24] From Constantinople he was expelled for some reason or another, returned to his own country and a second time made his defence, attempting to conceal his impious sentiments and cloking them under a certain verbal orthodoxy.

[263:25] He no sooner obtained the rank of bishop than he straightway appeared writing an anathema on the Homoousion in the Arians' synod at Ancyra.

[263:26] From thence he went to Seleucia and took part in the notorious measures of his fellow heretics.

[263:27] At Constantinople he assented a second time to the propositions of the heretics.

[263:28] On being ejected from his episcopate, on the ground of his former deposition at Melitine, he hit upon a journey to you as a means of restitution for himself.

[263:29] What propositions were made to him by the blessed bishop Liberius, and to what he agreed, I am ignorant.

[263:30] I only know that he brought a letter restoring him, which he shewed to the synod at Tyana, and was restored to his see.

[263:31] He is now defaming the very creed for which he was received; he is consorting with those who are anathematizing the Homoousion, and is prime leader of the heresy of the pneumatomachi.

[263:32] As it is from the west that he derives his power to injure the Churches, and uses the authority given him by you to the overthrow of the many, it is necessary that his correction should come from the same quarter, and that a letter be sent to the Churches stating on what terms he was received, and in what manner he has changed his conduct and nullifies the favour given him by the Fathers at that time.

[263:33] 4.

[263:34] Next comes Apollinarius, who is no less a cause of sorrow to the Churches.

[263:35] With his facility of writing, and a tongue ready to argue on any subject, he has filled the world with his works, in disregard of the advice of him who said, "Beware of making many books".

[263:36] In their multitude there are certainly many errors.

[263:37] How is it possible to avoid sin in a multitude of words? And the theological works of Apollinarius are founded on Scriptural proof, but are based on a human origin.

[263:38] He has written about the resurrection, from a mythical, or rather Jewish, point of view; urging that we shall return again to the worship of the Law, be circumcised, keep the Sabbath, abstain from meats, offer sacrifices to God, worship in the Temple at Jerusalem, and be altogether turned from Christians into Jews.

[263:39] What could be more ridiculous? Or, rather, what could be more contrary to the doctrines of the Gospel? Then, further, he has made such confusion among the brethren about the incarnation, that few of his readers preserve the old mark of true religion; but the more part, in their eagerness for novelty, have been diverted into investigations and quarrelsome discussions of his unprofitable treatises.

[263:40] 5.

[263:41] As to whether there is anything objectionable about the conversation of Paulinus, you can say yourselves.

[263:42] What distresses me is that he should shew an inclination for the doctrine of Marcellus, and unreservedly admit his followers to communion.

[263:43] You know, most honourable brethren, that the reversal of all our hope is involved in the doctrine of Marcellus, for it does not confess the Son in His proper hypostasis, but represents Him as having been sent forth, and as having again returned to Him from Whom He came; neither does it admit that the Paraclete has His own subsistence.

[263:44] It follows that no one could be wrong in declaring this heresy to be all at variance with Christianity, and in styling it a corrupt Judaism.

[263:45] Of these things I implore you to take due heed.

[263:46] This will be the case if you will consent to write to all the Churches of the East that those who have perverted these doctrines are in communion with you, if they amend; but that if they contentiously determine to abide by their innovations, you are separated from them.

[263:47] I am myself well aware, that it had been fitting for me to treat of these matters, sitting in synod with you in common deliberation.

[263:48] But this the time does not allow.

[263:49] Delay is dangerous, for the mischief they have caused has taken root.

[263:50] I have therefore been constrained to dispatch these brethren, that you may learn from them all that has been omitted in my letter, and that they may rouse you to afford the succour which we pray for to the Churches of the East.

[264:1] Letter CCLXIV.

[264:2] To Barses, bishop of Edessa, in exile.

[264:3] To Barses the bishop, truly God-beloved and worthy of all reverence and honour, Basil sends greeting in the Lord.

[264:4] As my dear brother Domninus is setting out to you, I gladly seize the opportunity of writing, and I greet you by him, praying the holy God that we may be so long preserved in this life as to be permitted to see you, and to enjoy the good gifts which you possess.

[264:5] Only pray, I beseech you, that the Lord may not deliver us for aye to the enemies of the Cross of Christ, but that He will keep His Churches, until the time of that peace which the just Judge Himself knows when He will bestow.

[264:6] For He will bestow it.

[264:7] He will not always abandon us.

[264:8] As He limited seventy years for the period of captivity for the Israelites in punishment for their sins, so peradventure the Mighty One, after giving us up for some appointed time, will recall us once again, and will restore us to the peace of the beginning—unless indeed the apostasy is now nigh at hand, and the events that have lately happened are the beginnings of the approach of Antichrist.

[264:9] If this be so, pray that the good Lord will either take away our afflictions, or preserve us through our afflictions unvanquished.

[264:10] Through you I greet all those who have been thought worthy to be associated with you.

[264:11] All who are with me salute your reverence.

[264:12] May you, by the grace of the Holy One, be preserved to the Church of God in good health, trusting in the Lord, and praying for me.

[265:1] Letter CCLXV.

[265:2] To Eulogius, Alexander, and Harpocration, bishops of Egypt, in exile.

[265:3] 1.

[265:4] In all things we find that the providence exercised by our good God over His Churches is mighty, and that thus the very things which seem to be gloomy, and do not turn out as we should like, are ordained for the advantage of most, in the hidden wisdom of God, and in the unsearchable judgments of His righteousness.

[265:5] Now the Lord has removed you from the regions of Egypt, and has brought you and established you in the midst of Palestine, after the manner of Israel of old, whom He carried away by captivity into the land of the Assyrians, and there extinguished idolatry through the sojourn of His saints.

[265:6] Now too we find the same thing, when we observe that the Lord is making known your struggle for the sake of true religion, opening to you through your exile the arena of your blessed contests, and to all who see before them your noble constancy, giving the boon of your good example to lead them to salvation.

[265:7] By God's grace, I have heard of the correctness of your faith, and of your zeal for the brethren and that it is in no careless or perfunctory spirit that you provide what is profitable and necessary for salvation, and that you support all that conduces to the edification of the Churches.

[265:8] I have therefore thought it right that I should be brought into communion with your goodness, and be united to your reverences by letter.

[265:9] For these reasons I have sent my very dear brother the deacon Elpidius, who not only conveys my letter, but is moreover fully qualified to announce to you whatever may have been omitted in my letter.

[265:10] 2.

[265:11] I have been specially moved to desire union with you by the report of the zeal of your reverences in the cause of orthodoxy.

[265:12] The constancy of your hearts has been stirred neither by multiplicity of books nor by variety of ingenious arguments.

[265:13] You have on the contrary, recognised those who endeavoured to introduce innovations in opposition to the apostolic doctrines, and you have refused to keep silence concerning the mischief which they are causing.

[265:14] I have in truth found great distress among all who cleave to the peace of the Lord at the divers innovations of Apollinarius of Laodicea.

[265:15] He has all the more distressed me from the fact that he seemed at the beginning on our side.

[265:16] A sufferer can in a certain sense endure what comes to him from an open enemy, even though it be exceedingly painful, as it is written, "For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it".

[265:17] But it is intolerable, and beyond the power of comfort, to be wronged by a close and sympathetic friend.

[265:18] Now that very man whom I have expected to have at my right hand in defence of the truth, I have found in many ways hindering those who are being saved, by seducing their minds and drawing them away from direct doctrine.

[265:19] What rash and hasty deed has he not done? What ill considered and dangerous argument has he not risked? Is not all the Church divided against herself, specially since the day when men have been sent by him to the Churches governed by orthodox bishops, to rend them asunder and to set up some peculiar and illegal service? Is not ridicule brought upon the great mystery of true religion when bishops go about without people and clergy, having nothing but the mere name and title, and effecting nothing for the advancement of the Gospel of peace and salvation? Are not his discourses about God full of impious doctrines, the old impiety of the insane Sabellius being now renewed by him in his writings? For if the works which are current among the Sebastenes are not the forgery of foes, and are really his composition, he has reached a height of impiety which cannot be surpassed, in saying that Father, Son, and Spirit are the same, and other dark pieces of irreverence which I have declined even to hear, praying that I may have nothing to do with those who have uttered them.

[265:20] Does he not confuse the doctrine of the incarnation? Has not the oeconomy of salvation been made doubtful to the many on account of his dark and cloudy speculations about it? To collect them all, and refute them, requires long time and much discussion.

[265:21] But where have the promises of the Gospel been blunted and destroyed as by his figments? So meanly and poorly has he dared to explain the blessed hope laid up for all who live according to the Gospel of Christ, as to reduce it to mere old wives' fables and doctrines of Jews.

[265:22] He proclaims the renewal of the Temple, the observance of the worship of the Law, a typical high priest over again after the real High Priest, and a sacrifice for sins after the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sin of the world.

[265:23] He preaches partial baptisms after the one baptism, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the Church which, through its faith in Christ, has not spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; cleansing of leprosy after the painless state of the resurrection; an offering of jealousy when they neither marry nor are given in marriage; shew-bread after the Bread from heaven; burning lamps after the true Light.

[265:24] In a word, if the law of the Commandments has been done away with by dogmas, it is plain that under these circumstances the dogmas of Christ will be nullified by the injunctions of the law.

[265:25] At these things shame and disgrace have covered my face, and heavy grief hath filled my heart.

[265:26] Wherefore, I beseech you, as skilful physicians, and instructed how to discipline antagonists with gentleness, to try and bring him back to the right order of the Church, and to persuade him to despise the wordiness of his own works; for he has proved the truth of the proverb "in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin".

[265:27] Put boldly before him the doctrines of orthodoxy, in order that his amendment may be published abroad, and his repentance made known to his brethren.

[265:28] 3.

[265:29] It is also desirable that I should remind your reverence about the followers of Marcellus, in order that you may decide nothing in their case rashly or inconsiderately.

[265:30] On account of his impious doctrines he has gone out from the Church.

[265:31] It is therefore necessary that his followers should only be received into communion on condition that they anathematize that heresy, in order that those who are united to me through you may be accepted by all the brethren.

[265:32] And now most men are moved to no small grief on hearing that you have both received them and admitted them to ecclesiastical communion on their coming to your excellency.

[265:33] Nevertheless you ought to have known that by God's grace you do not stand alone in the East, but have many in communion with you, who vindicate the orthodoxy of the Fathers, and who put forth the pious doctrine of the Faith at Nicaea.

[265:34] The Westerns also all agree with you and with me, whose exposition of the Faith I have received and keep with me, assenting to their sound doctrine.

[265:35] You ought, then, to have satisfied all who are in agreement with you, that the action which is being taken may be ratified by the general consent, and that peace may not be broken by the acceptance of some while others are kept apart.

[265:36] Thus you ought to have at the same time seriously and gently taken counsel about matters which are of importance to all the Churches throughout the world.

[265:37] Praise is not due to him who hastily determines any point, but rather to him who rules every detail firmly and unalterably, so that when his judgment is enquired into, even at a later time, it may be the more esteemed.

[265:38] This is the man who is acceptable both to God and man as one who guides his words with discretion.

[265:39] Thus I have addressed your reverence in such terms as are possible in a letter.

[265:40] May the Lord grant that one day we may meet, that so, after arranging everything together with you for the government of the Churches, I may with you receive the reward prepared by the righteous Judge for faithful and wise stewards.

[265:41] In the mean time be so good as to let me know with what intention you have received the followers of Marcellus, knowing this, that even if you secure everything, so far as you yourselves are concerned, you ought not to deal with a matter of such importance on your own sole responsibility.

[265:42] It is further necessary that the Westerns, and those who are in communion with them in the East, should concur in the restoration of these men.

[266:1] Letter CCLXVI.

[266:2] To Petrus, bishop of Alexandria.

[266:3] 1.

[266:4] You have very properly rebuked me, and in a manner becoming a spiritual brother who has been taught genuine love by the Lord, because I am not giving you exact and detailed information of all that is going on here, for it is both your part to be interested in what concerns me, and mine to tell you all that concerns myself.

[266:5] But I must tell you, right honourable and well-beloved brother, that our continuous afflictions, and this mighty agitation which is now shaking the Churches, result in my taking all that is happening as a matter of course.

[266:6] Just as in smithies where men whose ears are deafened get accustomed to the sound, so by the frequency of the strange tidings that reach me I have now grown accustomed to be undisturbed and undismayed at extraordinary events.

[266:7] So the policy which has been for a long time pursued by the Arians to the detriment of the Church, although their achievements have been many and great and noised abroad through all the world, has nevertheless been endurable to me, because of their being the work of open foes and enemies of the word of truth.

[266:8] It is when these men do something unusual that I am astonished, not when they attempt something great and audacious against true religion.

[266:9] But I am grieved and troubled at what is being done by men who feel and think with me.

[266:10] Yet their doings are so frequent and so constantly reported to me, that even they do not appear surprising.

[266:11] So it comes about that I was not agitated at the recent disorderly proceedings, partly because I knew perfectly well that common report would carry them to you without my help, and partly because I preferred to wait for somebody else to give you disagreeable news.

[266:12] And yet, further, I did not think it reasonable that I should show indignation at such proceedings, as though I were annoyed at suffering a slight.

[266:13] To the actual agents in the matter I have written in becoming terms, exhorting them, because of the dissension arising among some of the brethren there, not to fall away from charity, but to wait for the matter to be set right by those who have authority to remedy disorders in due ecclesiastical form.

[266:14] That you should have so acted, stirred by honourable and becoming motives, calls for my commendation, and moves my gratitude to the Lord that there remains preserved in you a relic of the ancient discipline, and that the Church has not lost her own might in my persecution.

[266:15] The canons have not suffered persecution as well as I.

[266:16] Though importuned again by the Galatians, I was never able to give them an answer, because I waited for your decision.

[266:17] Now, if the Lord so will and they will consent to listen to me, I hope that I shall be able to bring the people to the Church.

[266:18] It cannot then be cast in my teeth that I have gone over to the Marcellians, and they on the contrary will become limbs of the body of the Church of Christ.

[266:19] Thus the disgrace caused by heresy will be made to disappear by the method I adopt, and I shall escape the opprobrium of having gone over to them.

[266:20] 2.

[266:21] I have also been grieved by our brother Dorotheus, because, as he has himself written, he has not gently and mildly reported everything to your excellency.

[266:22] I set this down to the difficulty of the times.

[266:23] I seem to be deprived by my sins of all success in my undertakings, if indeed the best of my brethren are proved ill-disposed and incompetent, by their failure to perform their duties in accordance with my wishes.

[266:24] On his return Dorotheus reported to me the conversation which he had had with your excellency in the presence of the very venerable bishop Damasus, and he caused me distress by saying that our God-beloved brethren and fellow-ministers, Meletius and Eusebius, had been reckoned among the Ariomaniacs.

[266:25] If their orthodoxy were established by nothing else, the attacks made upon them by the Arians are, to the minds of all right thinking people, no small proof of their rectitude.

[266:26] Even your participation with them in sufferings endured for Christ's sake ought to unite your reverence to them in love.

[266:27] Be assured of this, right honourable sir, that there is no word of orthodoxy which has not been proclaimed by these men with all boldness.

[266:28] God is my witness.

[266:29] I have heard them myself.

[266:30] I should not certainly have now admitted them to communion, if I had caught them tripping in the faith.

[266:31] But, if it seem good to you, let us leave the past alone.

[266:32] Let us make a peaceful start for the future.

[266:33] For we have need one of another in the fellowship of the members, and specially now, when the Churches of the East are looking to us, and will take your agreement as a pledge of strength and consolidation.

[266:34] If, on the other hand, they perceive that you are in a state of mutual suspicion, they will drop their hands, and slacken in their resistance to the enemies of the faith.

[267:1] Letter CCLXVII.

[267:2] To Barses, bishop of Edessa, in exile.

[267:3] For the sake of the affection which I entertain for you, I long to be with you, to embrace you, my dear friend, in person, and to glorify the Lord Who is magnified in you, and has made your honourable old age renowned among all them that fear Him throughout the world.

[267:4] But severe sickness afflicts me, and to a greater degree than I can express in words, I am weighed down by the care of the Churches.

[267:5] I am not my own master, to go whither I will, and to visit whom I will.

[267:6] Therefore I am trying to satisfy the longing I have for the good gifts in you by writing to you, and I beseech your reverence to pray for me and for the Church, that the Lord may grant to me to pass the remaining days or hours of my sojourn here without offence.

[267:7] May He permit me to see the peace of His Churches.

[267:8] Of your fellow-ministers and fellow-athletes may I hear all that I pray for, and of yourself that you are granted such a lot as the people under you seek for by day and by night from the Lord of righteousness.

[267:9] I have not written often, not even so often as I ought, but I have written to your reverence.

[267:10] Possibly the brethren to whom I committed my greetings were not able to preserve them.

[267:11] But now that I have found some of my brethren travelling to your excellency, I have readily entrusted my letter to them, and I have sent some messages which I beg you to receive from my humility without disdain, and to bless me after the manner of the patriarch Isaac.

[267:12] I have been much occupied, and have had my mind drowned in a multiplicity of cares.

[267:13] So it may well be that I have omitted something which I ought to have said.

[267:14] If so, do not reckon it against me; and do not be grieved.

[267:15] Act in all things up to your own high character, that I, like every one else, may enjoy the fruit of your virtue.

[267:16] May you be granted to me and to the Church, in good health, rejoicing in the Lord, praying for me.

[268:1] Letter CCLXVIII.

[268:2] To Eusebius, in exile.

[268:3] Even in our time the Lord has taught us, by protecting with His great and powerful hand the life of your holiness, that He does not abandon His holy ones.

[268:4] I reckon your case to be almost like that of the saint remaining unhurt in the belly of the monster of the deep, or that of the men who feared the Lord, living unscathed in the fierce fire.

[268:5] For though the war is round about you on every side, He, as I hear, has kept you unharmed.

[268:6] May the mighty God keep you, if I live longer, to fulfil my earnest prayer that I may see you! If not for me, may He keep you for the rest, who wait for your return as they might for their own salvation.

[268:7] I am persuaded that the Lord in His loving-kindness will give heed to the tears of the Churches, and to the sighs which all are heaving over you, and will preserve you in life until He grant the prayer of all who night and day are praying to Him.

[268:8] Of all the measures taken against you, up to the arrival of our beloved brother Libanius the deacon, I have been sufficiently informed by him while on his way.

[268:9] I am anxious to learn what happened afterwards.

[268:10] I hear that in the meanwhile still greater troubles have occurred where you are; about all this, sooner if possible, but, if not, at least by our reverend brother Paul the presbyter, on his return, may I learn, as I pray that I may, that your life is preserved safe and sound.

[268:11] But on account of the report that all the roads are infested with thieves and deserters, I have been afraid to entrust anything to the brother's keeping, for fear of causing his death.

[268:12] If the Lord grant a little quiet, (as I am told of the coming of the army), I will try to send you one of my own men, to visit you, to bring me back news of everything about you.

[269:1] Letter CCLXIX.

[269:2] To the wife of Arinthaeus, the General.

[269:3] Consolatory.

[269:4] 1.

[269:5] It had been only proper, and due to your affection, that I should have been on the spot, and have taken part in the present occurrences.

[269:6] Thus I might have at once assuaged my own sorrow, and given some consolation to your excellency.

[269:7] But my body will no longer endure long journeys, and so I am driven to approach you by letter, that I seem not to count what has happened as altogether of no interest to me.

[269:8] Who has not mourned for that man? Who is so stony of heart as not to have shed a warm tear over him? I especially have been filled with mourning at the thought of all the marks of respect which I have received from him, and of the general protection which he has extended to the Churches of God.

[269:9] Nevertheless, I have bethought me that he was human, and had done the work he had to do in this life, and now in the appointed time has been taken back again by God Who ordains our lots.

[269:10] All this, I beseech you, in your wisdom, to take to heart, and to meet the event with meekness, and, so far as is possible, to endure your loss with moderation.

[269:11] Time may be able to soothe your heart, and allow the approach of reason.

[269:12] At the same time your great love for your husband, and your goodness to all, lead me to fear that, from the very simplicity of your character, the wound of your grief may pierce you deeply, and that you may give yourself up entirely to your feelings.

[269:13] The teaching of Scripture is always useful, and specially at times like this.

[269:14] Remember, then, the sentence passed by our Creator.

[269:15] By it all we who are dust shall return to dust.

[269:16] No one is so great as to be superior to dissolution.

[269:17] 2.

[269:18] Your admirable husband was a good and great man, and his bodily strength rivalled the virtues of his soul.

[269:19] He was unsurpassed, I must own, in both respects.

[269:20] But he was human, and he is dead; like Adam, like Abel, like Noah, like Abraham, like Moses, or any one else of like nature that you can name.

[269:21] Let us not then complain because he has been taken from us.

[269:22] Let us rather thank Him, who joined us to him, that we dwelt with him from the beginning.

[269:23] To lose a husband is a lot which you share with other women; but to have been united to such a husband is a boast which I do not think any other woman can make.

[269:24] In truth our Creator fashioned that man for us as a model of what human nature ought to be.

[269:25] All eyes were attracted towards him, and every tongue told of his deeds.

[269:26] Painters and sculptors fell short of his excellence, and historians, when they tell the story of his achievements in war, seem to fall into the region of the mythical and the incredible.

[269:27] Thus it has come about that most men have not even been able to give credit to the report conveying the sad tidings, or to accept the truth of the news that Arinthaeus is dead.

[269:28] Nevertheless Arinthaeus has suffered what will happen to heaven and to sun and to earth.

[269:29] He has died a bright death; not bowed down by old age; without losing one whit of his honour; great in this life; great in the life to come; deprived of nothing of his present splendour in view of the glory hoped for, because he washed away all the stain of his soul, in the very moment of his departure hence, in the laver of regeneration.

[269:30] That you should have arranged and joined in this rite is cause of supreme consolation.

[269:31] Turn now your thoughts from the present to the future, that you may be worthy through good works to obtain a place of rest like his.

[269:32] Spare an aged mother; spare a tender daughter, to whom you are now the sole comfort.

[269:33] Be an example of fortitude to other women, and so regulate your grief that you may neither eject it from your heart, nor be overwhelmed by your distress.

[269:34] Ever keep your eyes fixed on the great reward of patience, promised, as the requital of the deeds of this life, by our Lord Jesus Christ.

[270:1] Letter CCLXX.

[270:2] Without Address.

[270:3] Concerning Raptus.

[270:4] I am distressed to find that you are by no means indignant at the sins forbidden, and that you seem incapable of understanding, how this raptus, which has been committed, is an act of unlawfulness and tyranny against society and human nature, and an outrage on free men.

[270:5] I am sure that if you had all been of one mind in this matter, there would have been nothing to prevent this bad custom from being long ago driven out of your country.

[270:6] Do thou at the present time shew the zeal of a Christian man, and be moved as the wrong deserves.

[270:7] Wherever you find the girl, insist on taking her away, and restore her to her parents, shut out the man from the prayers, and make him excommunicate.

[270:8] His accomplices, according to the canon which I have already put forth, cut off, with all their household, from the prayers.

[270:9] The village which received the girl after the abduction, and kept her, or even fought against her restitution, shut out with all its inhabitants from the prayers; to the end that all may know that we regard the ravisher as a common foe, like a snake or any other wild beast, and so hunt him out, and help those whom he has wronged.

[271:1] Letter CCLXXI.

[271:2] To Eusebius, my comrade, to recommend Cyriacus the presbyter.

[271:3] At once and in haste, after your departure, I came to the town.

[271:4] Why need I tell a man not needing to be told, because he knows by experience, how distressed I was not to find you? How delightful it would have been to me to see once more the excellent Eusebius, to embrace him, to travel once again in memory to our young days, and to be reminded of old times when for both of us there was one home, one hearth, the same schoolmaster, the same leisure, the same work, the same treats, the same hardships, and everything shared in common! What do you think I would not have given to recall all this by actually meeting you, to rid me of the heavy weight of my old age, and to seem to be turned from an old man into a lad again? But I have lost this pleasure.

[271:5] At least of the privilege of meeting your excellency in correspondence, and of consoling myself by the best means at my disposal, I am not deprived.

[271:6] I am so fortunate as to meet the very reverend presbyter Cyriacus.

[271:7] I am ashamed to recommend him to you, and to make him, through me, your own, lest I seem to be performing a superfluous task in offering to you what you already possess and value as your own.

[271:8] But it is my duty to witness to the truth, and to give the best boons I have to those who are spiritually united to me.

[271:9] I think that the man's blamelessness in his sacred position is well known to you; but I confirm it, for I do not know that any charge is brought against him by those who do not fear the Lord and are laying their hands upon all.

[271:10] Even if they had done anything of the kind, the man would not have been unworthy, for the enemies of the Lord rather vindicate the orders of those whom they attack than deprive them of any of the grace given them by the Spirit.

[271:11] However, as I said, nothing has even been thought of against the man.

[271:12] Be so good then as to look upon him as a blameless presbyter, in union with me, and worthy of all reverence.

[271:13] Thus will you benefit yourself and gratify me.

[272:1] Letter CCLXXII.

[272:2] To Sophronius the magister officiorum.

[272:3] 1.

[272:4] It has been reported to me by Actiacus the deacon, that certain men have moved you to anger against me, by falsely stating me to be ill-disposed towards your excellency.

[272:5] I cannot be astonished at a man in your position being followed by certain sycophants.

[272:6] High position seems to be in some way naturally attended by miserable hangers-on of this kind.

[272:7] Destitute as they are of any good quality of their own whereby they may be known, they endeavour to recommend themselves by means of other people's ills.

[272:8] Peradventure, just as mildew is a blight which grows in corn, so flattery stealing upon friendship is a blight of friendship.

[272:9] So, as I said, I am by no means astonished that these men should buzz about your bright and distinguished hearth, as drones do about the hives.

[272:10] But what has moved my wonderment, and has seemed altogether astounding, is that a man like yourself, specially distinguished by the seriousness of your character, should have been induced to give both your ears to these people and to accept their calumny against me.

[272:11] From my youth up to this my old age I have felt affection for many men, but I am not aware that I have ever felt greater affection for any one than for your excellency.

[272:12] Even had not my reason induced me to regard a man of such a character, our intimacy from boyhood would have sufficed to attach me to your soul.

[272:13] You know yourself how much custom has to do with friendship.

[272:14] Pardon my deficiency, if I can show nothing worthy of this preference.

[272:15] You will not ask some deed from me in proof of my good will; you will be satisfied with a temper of mind which assuredly prays for you that you may have all that is best.

[272:16] May your fortunes never fall so low, as that you should need the aid of any one so insignificant as myself!  2.

[272:17] How then was I likely to say anything against you, or to take any action in the matter of Memnonius? These points were reported to me by the deacon.

[272:18] How could I put the wealth of Hymetius before the friendship of one so prodigal of his substance as you are? There is no truth in any of these things.

[272:19] I have neither said nor done anything against you.

[272:20] Possibly some ground may have been given for some of the lies that are being told, by my remarking to some of those who are causing disturbance, "If the man has determined to accomplish what he has in mind, then, whether you make disturbance or not, what he means to be done will certainly be done.

[272:21] You will speak, or hold your tongues; it will make no difference.

[272:22] If he changes his mind, beware how you defame my friend's honourable name.

[272:23] Do not, under the pretence of zeal in your patron's cause, attempt to make some personal profit out of your attempts to threaten and alarm".

[272:24] As to that person's making his will, I have never said one word, great or small, directly or indirectly, about the matter.

[272:25] 3.

[272:26] You must not refuse to believe what I say, unless you regard me as quite a desperate character, who thinks nothing of the great sin of lying.

[272:27] Put away all suspicion of me in relation to the business, and for the future reckon my affection for you as beyond the reach of all calumny.

[272:28] Imitate Alexander, who received a letter, saying that his physician was plotting his death, at the very moment when he was just about to drink his medicine, and was so far from believing the slanderer that he at one and the same time read the letter and drank the draught.

[272:29] I refuse to admit that I am in any way inferior to the men who have been famous for their friendship, for I have never been detected in any breach of mine; and, besides this, I have received from my God the commandment of love, and owe you love not only as part of mankind in general, but because I recognise you individually as a benefactor both of my country and of myself.

[273:1] Letter CCLXXIII.

[273:2] Without address.

[273:3] Concerning Hera.

[273:4] I am sure that your excellency loves me well enough to regard all that concerns me as concerning you.

[273:5] Therefore I commend to your great kindness and high consideration my very reverend brother Hera, whom I do not merely call brother by any conventional phrase, but because of his boundless affection.

[273:6] I beseech you to regard him as though he were nearly connected with yourself, and, so far as you can, to give him your protection in the matters in which he requires your generous and thoughtful aid.

[273:7] I shall then have this one more kindness to reckon in addition to the many which I have already received at your hands.

[274:1] Letter CCLXXIV.

[274:2] To Himerius, the master.

[274:3] That my friendship and affection for the very reverend brother Hera began when I was quite a boy, and has, by God's grace, continued up to my old age, no one knows better than yourself.

[274:4] For the Lord granted me the affection of your excellency at about the same time that He allowed me to become acquainted with Hera.

[274:5] He now needs your patronage, and I therefore beseech and supplicate you to do a favour for the sake of our old affection, and to heed the necessity under which we now lie.

[274:6] I beg you to make his cause your own, that he may need no other protection, but may return to me, successful in all that he is praying for.

[274:7] Then to the many kindnesses which I have received at your hands I shall be able to add yet this one more.

[274:8] I could not claim any favour more important to myself, or one more nearly touching my own interests.

[275:1] Letter CCLXXV.

[275:2] Without address.

[275:3] Concerning Hera.

[275:4] You have anticipated my entreaties in your affection for my very reverend brother Hera, and you have been better to him than I could have prayed for you to be in the abundant honour which you have shewn him, and the protection which you have extended to him on every occasion.

[275:5] But I cannot allow his affairs to go unnoticed by a word, and I must beseech your excellency that for my sake you will add something to the interest you have shewn in him, and will send him back to his own country victorious over the revilings of his enemies.

[275:6] Now many are trying to insult the peacefulness of his life, and he is not beyond the reach of envy's shafts.

[275:7] Against his foes we shall find one sure means of safety, if you will consent to extend your protection over him.

[276:1] Letter CCLXXVI.

[276:2] To the great Harmatius.

[276:3] The common law of human nature makes elders fathers to youngsters, and the special peculiar law of us Christians puts us old men in the place of parents to the younger.

[276:4] Do not, then, think that I am impertinent or shew myself indefensibly meddlesome, if I plead with you on behalf of your son.

[276:5] In other respects I think it only right that you should exact obedience from him; for, so far as his body is concerned, he is subject to you, both by the law of nature, and by the civil law under which we live.

[276:6] His soul, however, is derived from a diviner source, and may properly be held to be subject to another authority.

[276:7] The debts which it owes to God have a higher claim than any others.

[276:8] Since, then, he has preferred the God of us Christians, the true God, to your many gods which are worshipped by the help of material symbols, be not angry with him.

[276:9] Rather admire his noble firmness of soul, in sacrificing the fear and respect due to his father to close conjunction with God, through true knowledge and a life of virtue.

[276:10] Nature herself will move you, as well as your invariable gentleness and kindliness of disposition, not to allow yourself to feel angry with him even to a small extent.

[276:11] And I am sure that you will not set my mediation at naught,—or rather, I should say, the mediation of your townsmen of which I am the exponent.

[276:12] They all love you so well, and pray so earnestly for all blessings for you, that they suppose that in you they have welcomed a Christian too.

[276:13] So overjoyed have they been at the report which has suddenly reached the town.

[277:1] Letter CCLXXVII.

[277:2] To the learned Maximus.

[277:3] The excellent Theotecnus has given mean account of your highness, whereby he has inspired me with a longing for your acquaintance, so clearly do his words delineate the character of your mind.

[277:4] He has enkindled in me so ardent an affection for you, that were it not that I am weighed down with age, that I am the victim of a congenital ailment, that I am bound hand and foot by the numberless cares of the Church, nothing would have hindered my coming to you.

[277:5] For indeed it is no small gain that a member of a great house, a man of illustrious lineage, in adopting the life of the gospel, should bridle the propensities of youth by reflection, and subject to reason the affections of the flesh; should display a humility consistent with his Christian profession, bethinking himself, as is his duty, whence he is come and whither he is going.

[277:6] For it is this consideration of our nature that reduces the swelling of the mind, and banishes all boastfulness and arrogance.

[277:7] In a word it renders one a disciple of our Lord, Who said, "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart".

[277:8] And in truth, very dear son, the only thing that deserves our exertions and praises is our everlasting welfare; and this is the honour that comes from God.

[277:9] Human affairs are fainter than a shadow; more deceitful than a dream.

[277:10] Youth fades more quickly than the flowers of spring; our beauty wastes with age or sickness.

[277:11] Riches are uncertain; glory is fickle.

[277:12] The pursuit of arts and sciences is bounded by the present life; the charm of eloquence, which all covet, reaches but the ear: whereas the practice of virtue is a precious possession for its owner, a delightful spectacle for all who witness it.

[277:13] Make this your study; so will you be worthy of the good things promised by the Lord.

[277:14] But a recital of the means whereby to make the acquisition, and secure the enjoyment of these blessings, lies beyond the intention of this present letter.

[277:15] Thus much however, after what I heard from my brother Theotecnus, it occurred to me to write to you.

[277:16] I pray that he may always speak the truth, especially in his accounts of you; that the Lord may be the more glorified in you, abounding as you do in the most precious fruits of piety, although derived from a foreign root.

[278:1] Letter CCLXXVIII.

[278:2] To Valerianus.

[278:3] I desired, when in Orphanene, to see your excellency; I had also hoped that while you were living at Corsagaena, there would have been nothing to hinder your coming to me at a synod which I had expected to hold at Attagaena; since, however, I failed to hold it, my desire was to see you in the hill-country; for here again Evesus, being in that neighbourhood, held out hopes of our meeting.

[278:4] But since I have been disappointed on both occasions, I determined to write and beg that you would deign to visit me; for I think it is but right and proper that the young man should come to the old.

[278:5] Furthermore, at our meeting, I would make you a tender of my advice, touching your negotiations with certain at Caesarea: a right conclusion of the matter calls for my intervention.

[278:6] If agreeable then, do not be backward in coming to me.

[279:1] Letter CCLXXIX.

[279:2] To Modestus the Prefect.

[279:3] Although so numerous are my letters, conveyed to your excellency by as many bearers, yet, having regard to the especial honour you have shewn me, I cannot think that their large number causes you any annoyance.

[279:4] I do not hesitate therefore to entrust to this brother the accompanying letter: I know that he will meet with all that he wishes, and that you will count me but as a benefactor in furnishing occasion for the gratification of your kind inclinations.

[279:5] He craves your advocacy.

[279:6] His cause he will explain in person, if you but deign to regard him with a favourable eye, and embolden him to speak freely in the presence of so august an authority.

[279:7] Accept my assurance that any kindness shewn to him, I shall regard as personal to myself.

[279:8] His special reason for leaving Tyana and coming to me was the high value he attached to the presentation of a letter written by myself in support of his application.

[279:9] That he may not be disappointed of his hope; that I may continue in the enjoyment of your consideration; that your interest in all that is good may, in this present matter, find scope for its full exercise—are the grounds on which I crave a gracious reception for him, and a place amongst those nearest to you.

[280:1] Letter CCLXXX.

[280:2] To Modestus the Prefect.

[280:3] I feel my boldness in pressing my suit by letter upon a man in your position; still the honour that you have paid me in the past has banished all my scruples.

[280:4] Accordingly I write with confidence.

[280:5] My plea is for a relative of mine, a man worthy of respect for his integrity.

[280:6] He is the bearer of this letter, and he stands to me in the place of a son.

[280:7] Your favour is all that he requires for the fulfilment of his wishes.

[280:8] Deign therefore to receive, at the hands of the aforesaid bearer, my letter in furtherance of his plea.

[280:9] I pray you to give him an opportunity of explaining his affairs at an interview with those in a position to help him.

[280:10] So by your direction shall he quickly obtain his desires; while I shall have occasion for boasting that by God's favour I have found a champion who regards the entreaties of my friends as personal claims to his protection.

[281:1] Letter CCLXXXI.

[281:2] To Modestus the Prefect.

[281:3] I am mindful of the great honour I received in the encouragement you gave me, along with others, to address your excellency.

[281:4] I avail myself of the privilege and the enjoyment of your gracious favour.

[281:5] I congratulate myself upon having such a correspondent, as also upon the opportunity afforded your excellency of conferring an honour on me by your reply.

[281:6] I claim your clemency on behalf of Helladius my special friend.

[281:7] I pray that he may be relieved from the anxieties of Tax-assessor, and so be enabled to work in the interests of our country.

[281:8] You have already so far given a gracious consent, that I now repeat my request, and pray you to send instructions to the governor of the Province, that Helladius may be released from this infliction.

[282:1] Letter CCLXXXII.

[282:2] To a bishop.

[282:3] You blame me for not inviting you; and, when invited, you do not attend.

[282:4] That your former excuse was an empty one is clear from your conduct on the second occasion.

[282:5] For had you been invited before, in all probability you would never have come.

[282:6] Act not again unadvisedly, but obey this present invitation; since you know that its repetition strengthens an indictment, and that a second lends credibility to a previous accusation.

[282:7] I exhort you always to bear with me; or even if you cannot, at any rate it is your duty not to neglect the Martyrs, to join in whose commemoration you are invited.

[282:8] Render therefore your service to us both; or if you will not consent to this, at any rate to the more worthy.

[283:1] Letter CCLXXXIII.

[283:2] To a widow.

[283:3] I hope to find a suitable day for the conference, after those which I intend to fix for the hill-country.

[283:4] I see no opportunity for our meeting (unless the Lord so order it beyond my expectation), other than at a public conference.

[283:5] You may imagine my position from your own experience.

[283:6] If in the care of a single household you are beset with such a crowd of anxieties, how many distractions, think you, each day brings to me?  Your dream, I think, reveals more perfectly the necessity of making provision for spiritual contemplation, and cultivating that mental vision by which God is wont to be seen.

[283:7] Enjoying as you do the consolation of the Holy Scriptures, you stand in need neither of my assistance nor of that of anybody else to help you to comprehend your duty.

[283:8] You have the all-sufficient counsel and guidance of the Holy Spirit to lead you to what is right.

[284:1] Letter CCLXXXIV.

[284:2] To the assessor in the case of monks.

[284:3] Concerning the monks, your excellency has, I believe, already rules in force, so that I need ask for no special favour on their behalf.

[284:4] It is enough that they share with others the enjoyment of your general beneficence; still I feel it incumbent upon me too to interest myself in their case.

[284:5] I therefore submit it to your more perfect judgment, that men who have long since taken leave of this life, who have mortified their own bodies, so that they have neither money to spend nor bodily service to render in the interests of the common weal, should be exempted from taxation.

[284:6] For if their lives are consistent with their profession, they possess neither money nor bodies; for the former is spent in communicating to the needy; while their bodies are worn away in prayer and fasting.

[284:7] Men living such lives you will, I know, regard with special reverence; nay you will wish to secure their intervention, since by their life in the Gospel they are able to prevail with God.

[285:1] Letter CCLXXXV.

[285:2] Without Address.

[285:3] The hearer of this letter is one on whom rests the care of our Church and the management of its property—our beloved son.

[285:4] Deign to grant him freedom of speech on those points that are referred to your holiness, and attention to the expression of his own views; so shall our Church at length recover herself, and henceforth be released from this many-headed Hydra.

[285:5] Our property is our poverty; so much so that we are ever in search of one to relieve us of it; for the expenses of the Church property amount to more than any profit that she derives from it.

[286:1] Letter CCLXXXVI.

[286:2] To the Commentariensis.

[286:3] Whereas certain vagabonds have been arrested in the church for stealing, in defiance of God's commandment, some poor men's clothing, of little value otherwise, yet such as they had rather have on than off their backs; and whereas you consider that in virtue of your office you yourself should have the custody of the offenders:—I hereby declare, that I would have you know that for offences committed in the church it is our business to mete out punishment, and that the intervention of the civil authorities is in these cases superfluous.

[286:4] Wherefore, the stolen property, as set forth in the document in your possession and in the transcript made in the presence of eyewitnesses, I enjoin you to retain, reserving part for future claims, and distributing the rest among the present applicants.

[286:5] As for the offenders,—that they be corrected in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.

[286:6] By this means I hope to work their successive reformations.

[286:7] For where the stripes of human tribunals have failed, I have often known the fearful judgments of God to be effectual.

[286:8] If it is, however, your wish to refer this matter also to the count, such is my confidence in his justice and uprightness that I leave you to follow your own counsels.

[287:1] Letter CCLXXXVII.

[287:2] Without address.

[287:3] IT is difficult to deal with this man.

[287:4] I scarcely know how to treat so shifty, and, to judge from the evidence, so desperate a character.

[287:5] When summoned before the court, he fails to appear; and if he does attend, he is gifted with such volubility of words and oaths, that I think myself well off to be quickly rid of him.

[287:6] I have often known him twist round his accusations upon his accusers.

[287:7] In a word, there is no creature living upon earth so subtile and versatile in villainy.

[287:8] A slight acquaintance with him suffices to prove this.

[287:9] Why then do you appeal to me? Why not at once bring yourselves to submit to his ill-treatment, as to a visitation of God's anger?  At the same time you must not be contaminated by contact with wickedness.

[287:10] I enjoin therefore that he and all his household be forbidden the services of the Church, and all other communion with her ministers.

[287:11] Being thus made an example of, he may haply be brought to a sense of his enormities.

[288:1] Letter CCLXXXVIII.

[288:2] Without address.

[288:3] Excommunicatory.

[288:4] When public punishment fails to bring a man to his senses, or exclusion from the prayers of the Church to drive him to repentance, it only remains to treat him in accordance with our Lord's directions—as it is written, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee….

[288:5] tell him his fault between thee and him;…if he will not hear thee, take with thee another;" "and if he shall" then "neglect to hear, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to hear even the Church, let him be unto thee henceforth as an heathen man, and as a publican".

[288:6] Now all this we have done in the case of this fellow.

[288:7] First, he was accused of his fault; then he was convicted in the presence of one or two witnesses; thirdly, in the presence of the Church.

[288:8] Thus we have made our solemn protest, and he has not listened to it.

[288:9] Henceforth let him be excommunicated.

[288:10] Further, let proclamation be made throughout the district, that he be excluded from participation in any of the ordinary relations of life; so that by our withholding ourselves from all intercourse with him he may become altogether food for the devil.

[289:1] Letter CCLXXXIX.

[289:2] Without address.

[289:3] Concerning an afflicted woman.

[289:4] I consider it an equal mistake, to let the guilty go unpunished, and to exceed the proper limits of punishment.

[289:5] I accordingly passed upon this man the sentence I considered it incumbent on me to pass—excommunication from the Church.

[289:6] The sufferer I exhorted not to avenge herself; but to leave to God the redressing of her wrongs.

[289:7] Thus if my admonitions had possessed any weight, I should then have been obeyed, for the language I employed was far more likely to ensure credit, than any letter to enforce compliance.

[289:8] So, even after listening to her statements that contained matter sufficiently grave, I still held my peace; and even now I am not sure that it becomes me to treat again of this same question.

[289:9] For, she says, I have foregone husband, children, all the enjoyments of life, for the attainment of this single object, the favour of God, and good repute amongst men.

[289:10] Yet one day the offender, an adept from boyhood in corrupting families, with the impudence habitual to him, forced an entrance into my house; and thus within the bare limits of an interview an acquaintanceship was formed.

[289:11] It was only owing to my ignorance of the man, and to that timidity which comes from inexperience, that I hesitated openly to turn him out of doors.

[289:12] Yet to such a pitch of impiety and insolence did he come, that he filled the whole city with slanders, and publicly inveighed against me by affixing to the church doors libellous placards.

[289:13] For this conduct, it is true, he incurred the displeasure of the law: but, nevertheless, he returned to his slanderous attacks on me.

[289:14] Once more the market-place was filled with his abuse, as well as the gymnasia, theatres, and houses whose congeniality of habits gained him an admittance.

[289:15] Nor did his very extravagance lead men to recognise those virtues wherein I was conspicuous, so universally had I been represented as being of an incontinent disposition.

[289:16] In these calumnies, she goes on to say, some find a delight—such is the pleasure men naturally feel in the disparagement of others; some profess to be pained, but shew no sympathy; others believe the truth of these slanders; others again, having regard to the persistency of his oaths, are undecided.

[289:17] But sympathy I have none.

[289:18] And now indeed I begin to realise my loneliness, and bewail myself.

[289:19] I have no brother, friend, relation, no servant, bond or free, in a word, no one whatever to share my grief.

[289:20] And yet, I think, I am more than any one else an object of pity, in a city where the haters of wickedness are so few.

[289:21] They bandy violence; but violence, though they fail to see it, moves in a circle, and in time will overtake each one of them.

[289:22] In such and still more appealing terms she told her tale, with countless tears, and so departed.

[289:23] Nor did she altogether acquit me of blame; thinking that, when I ought to sympathise with her like a father, I am indifferent to her troubles, and regard the sufferings of others too philosophically.

[289:24] For it is not, she urged, the loss of money that you bid me disregard; nor the endurance of bodily sufferings; but a damaged reputation, an injury involving loss upon the Church at large.

[289:25] This is her appeal; and now I pray you, most excellent sir, consider what answer you would have me make her.

[289:26] The decision I have come to in my own mind is, not to surrender offenders to the magistrates; yet not to rescue those already in their custody, since it has long ago been declared by the Apostle, that the magistrates should be a terror to them in their evil-doings; for, it is said, "he beareth not the sword in vain".

[289:27] To surrender him, then, is contrary to my humanity; while to release him would be an encouragement to his violence.

[289:28] Perhaps, however, you will defer taking action until my arrival.

[289:29] I will then shew you that I can effect nothing from there being none to obey me.

[290:1] Letter CCXC.

[290:2] To Nectarius.

[290:3] May many blessings rest on those who encourage your excellency in maintaining a constant correspondence with me! And regard not such a wish as conventional merely, but as expressing my sincere conviction of the value of your utterances.

[290:4] Whom could I honour above Nectarius—known to me from his earliest days as a child of fairest promise, who now through the exercise of every virtue has reached a position of the highest eminence?—So much so, that of all my friends the dearest is the bearer of your letter.

[290:5] Touching the election of those set over districts, God forbid that I should do anything for the gratification of man, through listening to importunities or yielding to fear.

[290:6] In that case I should be not a steward, but a huckster, battering the gift of God for the favour of man.

[290:7] But seeing that votes are given but by mortals, who can only bear such testimony as they do from outward appearances, while the choice of fit persons is committed in all humility to Him Who knows the secrets of the heart, haply it is best for everybody, when he has tendered the evidence of his vote, to abstain from all heat and contention, as though some self-interest were involved in the testimony, and to pray to God that what is advantageous may not remain unknown.

[290:8] Thus the result is no longer attributable to man, but a cause for thankfulness to God.

[290:9] For these things, if they be of man, cannot be said to be; but are pretence only, altogether void of reality.

[290:10] Consider also, that when a man strives with might and main to gain his end, there is no small danger of his drawing even sinners to his side; and there is much sinfulness, such is the weakness of man's nature, even where we should least expect it.

[290:11] Again, in private consultation we often offer our friends good advice, and, though we do not find them taking it, yet we are not angry.

[290:12] Where then it is not man that counsels, but God that determines, shall we feel indignation at not being preferred before the determination of God?  And if these things were given to man by man, what need were there for us to ask them of ourselves? Were it not better for each to take them from himself? But if they are the gift of God, we ought to pray and not to grieve.

[290:13] And in our prayer we should not seek our own will, but leave it to God who disposes for the best.

[290:14] Now may the holy God keep from your home all taste of sorrow; and grant to you and to your family a life exempt from harm and sickness.

[291:1] Letter CCXCI.

[291:2] To Timotheus the Chorepiscopus.

[291:3] The due limits of a letter, and that mode of addressing you, render it inconvenient for me to write all I think; at the same time to pass over my thoughts in silence, when my heart is burning with righteous indignation against you, is well-nigh impossible.

[291:4] I will adopt the midway course: I will write some things; others I will omit.

[291:5] For I wish to chide you, if so I may, in terms both flank and friendly.

[291:6] Yes! that Timotheus whom I have known from boyhood, so intent upon an upright and ascetic life, as even to be accused of excess therein, now forsakes the enquiry after those means whereby we may be united to God; now makes it his first thought what some one else may think of him, and lives a life of dependence upon the opinions of others; is mainly anxious how to serve his friends, without incurring the ridicule of enemies; and fears disgrace with the world as a great misfortune.

[291:7] Does he not know, that while he is occupied with these trifles he is unconsciously neglecting his highest interests? For, that we cannot be engaged with both at once—the things of this world and of Heaven—the holy Scriptures are full of teaching for us.

[291:8] Nay, Nature herself is full of such instances.

[291:9] In the exercise of the mental faculty, to think two thoughts at the same time is quite impossible.

[291:10] In the perceptions of our senses, to admit two sounds falling upon our ears at the same moment, and to distinguish them, although we are provided with two open passages, is impossible.

[291:11] Our eyes, again, unless they are both fixed upon the object of our vision, are unable to perform their action accurately.

[291:12] Thus much for Nature; but to recite to you the evidence of the Scriptures were as ridiculous as, so runs the proverb, 'to carry owls to Athens.

[291:13] ' Why then combine things incompatible—the tumults of civil life and the practice of religion?  Withdraw from clamour; be no more the cause or object of annoyance; let us keep ourselves to ourselves.

[291:14] We long since proposed religion as our aim; let us make the attainment of it our practice, and shew those who have the wish to insult us that it does not lie with them to annoy us at their will.

[291:15] But this will only be when we have clearly shewn them that we afford no handle for abuse.

[291:16] For the present enough of this! Would that some day we might meet and more perfectly consider those things that be for our souls' welfare; so may we not be too much occupied with thoughts of vanity, since death must one day overtake us.

[291:17] I was greatly pleased with the gifts you kindly sent me.

[291:18] They were most welcome on their own account; the thought of who it was that sent them made them many times more welcome.

[291:19] The gifts from Pontus, the tablets and medicines, kindly accept when I send them.

[291:20] At present they are not by me.

[291:28] Some are doubtful, and some plainly spurious.

[291:29] Of these I include such as seem most important.

[292:1] Letter CCXCII.

[292:2] To Palladius.

[292:3] The one-half of my desire has God fulfilled in the interview He granted me with our fair sister, your wife.

[292:4] The other half He is able to accomplish; and so with the sight of your excellency I shall render my full thanks to God.

[292:5] And I am the more desirous of seeing you, now that I hear you have been adorned with that great ornament, the clothing of immortality, which clokes our mortality, and puts out of sight the death of the flesh; by virtue of which the corruptible is swallowed up in incorruption.

[292:6] Thus God of His goodness has now alienated you from sin, united you to Himself, has opened the doors of Heaven, and pointed out the paths that lead to heavenly bliss.

[292:7] I entreat you therefore by that wisdom wherein you excel all other men, that you receive the divine favour circumspectly, proving a faithful guardian of this treasure, as the repository of this royal gift, keeping watch over it with all carefulness.

[292:8] Preserve this seal of righteousness unsullied, that so you may stand before God, shining in the brightness of the Saints.

[292:9] Let no spot or wrinkle defile the pure robe of immortality; but keep holiness in all your members, as having put on Christ.

[292:10] "For," it is said, "as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ".

[292:11] Wherefore let all your members be holy as becomes their investment in a raiment of holiness and light.

[293:1] Letter CCXCIII.

[293:2] To Julianus.

[293:3] How fare you this long while? Have you altogether recovered the use of your hand? And how do other things prosper? According to your wishes and my prayers? In accordance with your purposes?  Where men are readily disposed to change, it is only natural that their lives are not well ordered: but where their minds are fixed, steadfast and unalterable, it follows that their lives should be conformable to their purposes.

[293:4] True, it is not in the helmsman's power to make a calm when he wishes; but with us, it is quite easy to render our lives tranquil by stilling the storms of passion that surge within, by rising superior to those that assail us from without.

[293:5] The upright man is touched by neither loss, nor sickness, nor the other ills of life; for he walks in heart with God, keeps his gaze fixed upon the future, and easily and lightly weathers the storms that rise from earth.

[293:6] Be not troubled with the cares of earth.

[293:7] Such men are like fat birds, in vain endowed with flight, that creep like beasts upon the ground.

[293:8] But you—for I have witnessed you in difficulties—are like swimmers racing out at sea.

[293:9] A single claw reveals the whole lion: so from a slight acquaintance I think I know you fully.

[293:10] And I count it a great thing, that you set some store by me, that I am not absent from your thoughts, but constantly in your recollection.

[293:11] Now writing is a proof of recollection; and the oftener you write, the better pleased I am.

[294:1] Letter CCXCIV.

[294:2] To Festus and Magnus.

[294:3] It is doubtless a father's duty to make provision for his children; a husbandman's to tend his plants and crops; a teacher's to bestow care upon his pupils, especially when, innate goodness shews signs of promise for them.

[294:4] The husbandman finds toil a pleasure when he sees the ears ripen or the plants increase; the teacher is gladdened at his pupils' growth in knowledge, the father at his son's in stature.

[294:5] But greater is the care I feel for you; higher the hopes I entertain; in proportion as piety is more excellent than all the arts, than all the animals and fruits together.

[294:6] And piety I planted in your heart while still pure and tender, and I matured it in the hopes of seeing it reach maturity and bearing fruits in due season.

[294:7] My prayers meanwhile were furthered by your love of learning.

[294:8] And you know well that you have my good wishes, and that God's favour rests upon your endeavours; for when rightly directed, called or uncalled, God is at hand to further them.

[294:9] Now every man that loves God is prone to teaching; nay, where there is the power to teach things profitable, their eagerness is well nigh uncontrollable; but first their hearers' minds must be cleared of all resistance.

[294:10] Not that separation in the body is a hindrance to instruction.

[294:11] The Creator, in the fulness of His love and wisdom, did not confine our minds within our bodies, nor the power of speaking to our tongues.

[294:12] Ability to profit derives some advantage even from lapse of time; thus we are able to transmit instruction, not only to those who are dwelling far away, but even to those who are hereafter to be born.

[294:13] And experience proves my words: those who lived many years before teach posterity by instruction preserved in their writings; and we, though so far separated in the body, are always near in thought, and converse together with ease.

[294:14] Instruction is bounded neither by sea nor land, if only we have a care for our souls' profit.

[295:1] Letter CCXCV.

[295:2] To monks.

[295:3] I do not think that I need further commend you to God's grace, after the words that I addressed to you in person.

[295:4] I then bade you adopt the life in common, after the manner of living of the Apostles.

[295:5] This you accepted as wholesome instruction, and gave God thanks for it.

[295:6] Thus your conduct was due, not so much to the words I spoke, as to my instructions to put them into practice, conducive at once to your advantage who accepted, to my comfort who gave you the advice, and to the glory and praise of Christ, by Whose name we are called.

[295:7] For this reason I have sent to you our well-beloved brother, that he may learn of your zeal, may quicken your sloth, may report to me of opposition.

[295:8] For great is my desire to see you all united in one body, and to hear that you are not content to live a life without witness; but have undertaken to be both watchful of each other's diligence, and witnesses of each other's success.

[295:9] Thus will each of you receive a reward in full, not only on his own behalf, but also for his brother's progress.

[295:10] And, as is fitting, you will be a source of mutual profit, both by your words and deeds, as a result of constant intercourse and exhortation.

[295:11] But above all I exhort you to be mindful of the faith of the Fathers, and not to be shaken by those who in your retirement would try to wrest you from it.

[295:12] For you know that unless illumined by faith in God, strictness of life availeth nothing; nor will a right confession of faith, if void of good works, be able to present you before the Lord.

[295:13] Faith and works must be joined: so shall the man of God be perfect, and his life not halt through any imperfection.

[295:14] For the faith which saves us, as saith the Apostle, is that which worketh by love.

[298:3] [A short letter of commendation.

[298:4] ].

[299:1] Letter CCXCIX.

[299:2] To a Censitor.

[299:3] I was aware, before you told me, that you do not like your employment in public affairs.

[299:4] It is an old saying that those who are anxious to lead a pious life do not throw themselves with pleasure into office.

[299:5] The case of magistrates seems to me like that of physicians.

[299:6] They see awful sights; they meet with bad smells; they get trouble for themselves out of other people's calamities.

[299:7] This is at least the case with those who are real magistrates.

[299:8] All men who are engaged in business, look also to make a profit, and are excited about this kind of glory, count it the greatest possible advantage to acquire some power and influence by which they may be able to benefit their friends, punish their enemies, and get what they want for themselves.

[299:9] You are not a man of this kind.

[299:10] How should you be? You have voluntarily withdrawn from even high office in the State.

[299:11] You might have ruled the city like one single house, but you have preferred a life free from care and anxiety.

[299:12] You have placed a higher value on having no troubles yourself and not troubling other people, than other people do on making themselves disagreeable.

[299:13] But it has seemed good to the Lord that the district of Ibora should not be under the power of hucksters, nor be turned into a mere slave market.

[299:14] It is His will that every individual in it should be enrolled, as is right.

[299:15] Do you therefore accept this responsibility? It is vexatious, I know, but it is one which may bring you the approbation of God.

[299:16] Neither fawn upon the great and powerful, nor despise the poor and needy.

[299:17] Show to all under your rule an impartiality of mind, balanced more exactly than any scales.

[299:18] Thus in the sight of those who have entrusted you with these responsibilities your zeal for justice will be made evident, and they will view you with exceptional admiration.

[299:19] And even though you go unnoticed by them, you will not be unnoticed by our God.

[299:20] The prizes which He has put before us for good works are great.

[303:2] To the Comes Privatarum.

[303:3] You have, I think, been led to impose a contribution of mares on these people by false information on the part of the inhabitants.

[303:4] What is going on is quite unfair.

[303:5] It cannot but be displeasing to your excellency, and is distressing to me on account of my intimate connexion with the victims of the wrong.

[303:6] I have therefore lost no time in begging your Lordship not to allow these promoters of iniquity to succeed in their malevolence.

[306:1] Letter CCCVI.

[306:2] To the Governor of Sebasteia.

[306:3] I am aware that your excellency is favourably receiving my letters, and I understand why.

[306:4] You love all that is good; you are ready in doing kindnesses.

[306:5] So whenever I give you the opportunity of shewing your magnanimity, you are eager for my letters, because you know that they furnish an occasion for good deeds.

[306:6] Now, once more, behold an occasion for your shewing all the signs of rectitude, and at the same time for the public exhibition of your virtues! Certain persons have come from Alexandria for the discharge of a necessary duty which is due from all men to the dead.

[306:7] They ask your excellency to give orders that it may be permitted them to have conveyed away, under official sanction, the corpse of a relative who departed this life at Sebasteia, while the troops were quartered there.

[306:8] They further beg that, as far as possible, aid may be given them for travelling at the public expense, so that, of your bounty, they may find some help and solace in their long journey.

[306:9] The tidings of this will travel as far as to great Alexandria, and will convey thither the report of your excellency's astonishing kindness.

[306:10] This you well understand without my mentioning it.

[306:11] I shall add gratitude for this one more favour to that which I feel for all which you have done me.

[326:1] Letter CCCXXXIV.

[326:2] To a writer.

[326:3] Write straight, and make the lines straight.

[326:4] Do not let your hand go too high or too low.

[326:5] Avoid forcing the pen to travel slantwise, like aesop's crab.

[326:6] Advance straight on, as if following the line of the carpenter's rule, which always preserves exactitude and prevents any irregularity.

[326:7] The oblique is ungraceful.

[326:8] It is the straight which pleases the eye, and does not allow the reader's eyes to go nodding up and down like a swing-beam.

[326:9] This has been my fate in reading your writing.

[326:10] As the lines lie ladderwise, I was obliged, when I had to go from one to another, to mount up to the end of the last: then, when no connexion was to be found, I had to go back, and seek for the right order again, retreating and following the furrow, like Theseus in the story following Ariadne's thread.

[326:11] Write straight, and do not confuse our mind by your slanting and irregular writing.

[327:1] Letter CCCXXXV.

[327:2] Basil to Libanius.

[327:3] I am really ashamed of sending you the Cappadocians one by one.

[327:4] I should prefer to induce all our youths to devote themselves to letters and learning, and to avail themselves of your instruction in their training.

[327:5] But it is impracticable to get hold of them all at once, while they choose what suits themselves.

[327:6] I therefore send you those who from time to time are won over; and this I do with the assurance that I am conferring on them a boon as great as that which is given by those who bring thirsty men to the fountain.

[327:7] The lad, whom I am now sending, will be highly valued for his own sake when he has been in your society.

[327:8] He is already well known on account of his father, who has won a name among us both for rectitude of life and for authority in our community.

[327:9] He is, moreover, a close friend of my own.

[327:10] To requite him for his friendship to me, I am conferring on his son the benefit of an introduction to you—a boon well worthy of being earnestly prayed for by all who are competent to judge of a man's high character.

[328:1] Letter CCCXXXVI.

[328:2] Libanius to Basilius.

[328:3] 1.

[328:4] After some little time a young Cappadocian has reached me.

[328:5] One gain to me is that he is a Cappadocian.

[328:6] But this Cappadocian is one of the first rank.

[328:7] This is another gain.

[328:8] Further, he brings me a letter from the admirable Basil.

[328:9] This is the greatest gain of all.

[328:10] You think that I have forgotten you.

[328:11] I had great respect for you in your youth.

[328:12] I saw you vying with old men in self-restraint, and this in a city teeming with pleasures.

[328:13] I saw you already in possession of considerable learning.

[328:14] Then you thought that you ought also to see Athens, and you persuaded Celsus to accompany you.

[328:15] Happy Celsus, to be dear to you! Then you returned, and lived at home, and I said to myself, What, I wonder, is Basil about now? To what occupation has he betaken himself? Is he following the ancient orators, and practising in the courts? Or is he turning the sons of fortunate fathers into orators? Then there came those who reported to me that you were adopting a course of life better than any of these, and were, rather, bethinking you how you might win the friendship of God than heaps of gold, I blessed both you and the Cappadocians; you, for making this your aim; them, for being able to point to so noble a fellow-countryman.

[328:16] 2.

[328:17] I am aware that the Firmus, whom you mention, has continually won everywhere; hence his great power as a speaker.

[328:18] But with all the eulogies that have been bestowed on him, I am not aware that he has ever received such praise as I have heard of in your letter.

[328:19] For what a credit it is to him, that it should be you who declare that his reputation is inferior to none!  Apparently, you have despatched this young man to me before seeing Firminus; had you done so, your letters would not have failed to mention him.

[328:20] What is Firminus now doing or intending to do? Is he still anxious to be married? Or is all that over now? Are the claims of the senate heavy on him? Is he obliged to stay where he is? Is there any hope of his taking to study again ? Let him send me an answer, and I trust it may be satisfactory.

[328:21] If it be a distressing one, at least it will relieve him from seeing me at his door.

[328:22] And if Firminus had been now at Athens, what would your senators have done? Would they have sent the Salaminia after him? You see that it is only by your fellow-countrymen that I am wronged.

[328:23] Yet I shall never cease to love and praise the Cappadocians.

[328:24] I should like them to be better disposed to me, but, if they continue to act as they do, I shall bear it.

[328:25] Firminus was four months with me, and was not a day idle.

[328:26] You will know how much he has acquired, and perhaps will not complain.

[328:27] As to his being able to come here again, what ally can I call in? If your senators are right-minded, as men of education ought to be, they will honour me in the second case, since they grieved me in the first.

[329:1] Letter CCCXXXVII.

[329:2] Basil to Libanius.

[329:3] Lo and behold, yet another Cappadocian has come to you; a son of my own! Yet my present position makes all men my sons.

[329:4] On this ground he may be regarded as a brother of the former one, and worthy of the same attention alike from me his father, and from you his instructor—if really it is possible for these young men, who come from me, to obtain any further favours.

[329:5] I do not mean that it is not possible for your excellency to give anything more to your old comrades, but because your services are so lavishly bestowed upon all.

[329:6] It will be sufficient for the lad before he gets experience if he be numbered among those who are intimately known to you.

[329:7] I trust you may send him back to me worthy of my prayers and of your great reputation in learning and eloquence.

[329:8] He is accompanied by a young man of his own age, and of like zeal for instruction; a youth of good family, and closely associated with myself.

[329:9] I am sure he will be in every way as well treated, though his means are smaller than is the case with the rest.

[330:1] Letter CCCXXXVIII.

[330:2] Libanius to Basil.

[330:3] I know you will often write, "Here is another Cappadocian for you!" I expect that you will send me many.

[330:4] I am sure that you are everywhere putting pressure on both fathers and sons by all your complimentary expressions about me.

[330:5] But it would not be kind on my part not to mention what happened about your good letter.

[330:6] There were sitting with me not a few of our people of distinction, and among them the very excellent Alypius, Hierocles' cousin.

[330:7] The messengers gave in the letter.

[330:8] I read it right through without a word; then with a smile, and evidently gratified, I exclaimed, "I am vanquished!" "How? When? Where?" they asked.

[330:9] "How is it that you are not distressed at being vanquished?" "I am beaten," I replied, "in beautiful letter writing.

[330:10] Basil has won.

[330:11] But I love him; and so I am delighted".

[330:12] On hearing this, they all wanted to hear of the victory from the letter itself.

[330:13] It was read by Alypius, while all listened.

[330:14] It was voted that what I had said was quite true.

[330:15] Then the reader went out, with the letter still in his hand, to shew it, I suppose, to others.

[330:16] I had some difficulty in getting it back.

[330:17] Go on writing others like it; go on winning.

[330:18] This is for me to win.

[330:19] You are quite right in thinking that my services are not measured by money.

[330:20] Enough for him who has nothing to give, that he is as wishful to receive.

[330:21] If I perceive any one who is poor to be a lover of learning, he takes precedence of the rich.

[330:22] True, I never found such instructors; but nothing shall stand in the way of my being, at least in that respect, an improvement on mine.

[330:23] Let no one, then, hesitate to come hither because he is poor, if only he possesses the one qualification of knowing how to work.

[331:1] Letter CCCXXXIX.

[331:2] Basil to Libanius.

[331:3] What could not a sophist say? And such a sophist! One whose peculiar art is, whenever he likes, to make great things small, and to give greatness to small things! This is what you have shewn in my case.

[331:4] That dirty little letter of mine, as, perhaps, you who live in all luxury of eloquence would call it, a letter in no way more tolerable than the one you hold in your hands now, you have so extolled as, forsooth, to be eaten by it, and to be yielding me the prize for composition! You are acting much as fathers do, when they join in their boys' games, and let the little fellows be proud of the victories which they have let them win without any loss to themselves, and with much gain to the children's emulation.

[331:5] Really and truly the delight your speech must have given, when you were joking about me, must have been indescribable! It is as though some Polydamas or Milo were to decline the pancratium or a wrestling bout with me! After carefully examining, I have found no sign of weakness.

[331:6] So those who look for exaggeration are the more astonished at your being able to descend in sport to my level, than if you had led the barbarian in full sail over Athos.

[331:7] I, however, my dear sir, am now spending my time with Moses and Elias, and saints like them, who tell me their stories in a barbarous tongue, and I utter what I learnt from them, true, indeed, in sense, though rude in phrase, as what I am writing testifies.

[331:8] If ever I learned anything from you, I have forgotten it in the course of time.

[331:9] But do you continue to write to me, and so suggest other topics for correspondence.

[331:10] Your letter will exhibit you, and will not convict me.

[331:11] I have already introduced to you the son of Anysius, as a son of my own.

[331:12] If he is my son, he is the child of his father, poor, and a poor man's son.

[331:13] What I am saying is well known to one who is wise as well as a sophist.

[332:1] Letter CCCXL.

[332:2] Libanius to Basil.

[332:3] Had you been for a long time considering how best you could reply to my letter about yours, you could not in my judgment have acquitted yourself better than by writing as you have written now.

[332:4] You call me a sophist, and you allege that it is a sophist's business to make small things great and great things small.

[332:5] And you maintain that the object of my letter was to prove yours a good one, when it was not a good one, and that it was no better than the one which you have sent last, and, in a word that you have no power of expression, the books which you have now in hand producing no such effect, and the eloquence which you once possessed having all disappeared.

[332:6] Now, in the endeavour to prove this, you have made this epistle too, which you are reviling, so admirable, that my visitors could not refrain from leaping with admiration as it was being read.

[332:7] I was astonished that after your trying to run down the former one by this, by saying that the former one was like it, you have really complimented the former by it.

[332:8] To carry out your object, you ought to have made this one worse, that you might slander the former.

[332:9] But it is not like you, I think, to do despite to the truth.

[332:10] It would have been done despite to, if you had purposely written badly, and not put out the powers you have.

[332:11] It would be characteristic of you not to find fault with what is worthy of praise, lest in your attempt to make great things insignificant, your proceedings reduce you to the rank of the sophists.

[332:12] Keep to the books which you say are inferior in style, though better in sense.

[332:13] No one hinders you.

[332:14] But of the principles which are ever mine, and once were yours, the roots both remain and will remain, as long as you exist.

[332:15] Though you water them ever so little, no length of time will ever completely destroy them.

[333:1] Letter CCCXLI.

[333:2] Libanius to Basil.

[333:3] You have not yet ceased to be offended with me, and so I tremble as I write.

[333:4] If you have cared, why, my dear sir, do you not write? If you are still offended, a thing alien from any reasonable soul and from your own, why, while you are preaching to others, that they must not keep their anger till sundown, have you kept yours during many suns? Peradventure you have meant to punish me by depriving me of the sound of your sweet voice? Nay; excellent sir, be gentle, and let me enjoy your golden tongue.

[334:1] Letter CCCXLII.

[334:2] Basil to Libanius.

[334:3] All who are attached to the rose, as might be expected in the case of lovers of the beautiful, are not displeased even at the thorns from out of which the flower blows.

[334:4] I have even heard it said about roses by some one, perhaps in jest, or, it may be, even in earnest, that nature has furnished the bloom with those delicate thorns, like stings of love to lovers, to excite those who pluck them to intenser longing by these ingeniously adapted pricks.

[334:5] But what do I mean by this introduction of the rose into my letter? You do not need telling, when you remember your own letter.

[334:6] It had indeed the bloom of the rose, and, by its fair speech, opened out all spring to me; but it was bethorned with certain fault findings and charges against me.

[334:7] But even the thorn of your words is delightful to me, for it enkindles in me a greater longing for your friendship.

[335:1] Letter CCCXLIII.

[335:2] Libanius to Basil.

[335:3] IF these are the words of an untrained tongue, what would you be if you would polish them? On your lips live fountains of words better than the flowing of springs.

[335:4] I, on the contrary, if I am not daily watered, am silent.

[336:1] Letter CCCXLIV.

[336:2] Basil to Libanius.

[336:3] I am dissuaded from writing often to you, learned as you are, by my timidity and my ignorance.

[336:4] But your persistent silence is different.

[336:5] What excuse can be offered for it? If any one takes into account that you are slow to write to me, living as you do in the midst of letters, he will condemn you for forgetfulness of me.

[336:6] He who is ready at speaking is not unprepared to write.

[336:7] And if a man so endowed is silent, it is plain that he acts either from forgetfulness or from contempt.

[336:8] I will, however, requite your silence with a greeting.

[336:9] Farewell, most honoured sir.

[336:10] Write if you like.

[336:11] If you prefer it, do not write.

[337:1] Letter CCCXLV.

[337:2] Libanius to Basil.

[337:3] It is, I think, more needful for me to defend myself for not having begun to write to you long ago, than to offer any excuse for beginning now.

[337:4] I am that same man who always used to run up whenever you put in an appearance, and who listened with the greatest delight to the stream of your eloquence; rejoicing to hear you; with difficulty tearing myself away; saying to my friends, This man is thus far superior to the daughters of Achelous, in that, like them, he soothes, but he does not hurt as they do.

[337:5] Truly it is no great thing not to hurt; but this man's songs are a positive gain to the hearer.

[337:6] That I should be in this state of mind, should think that I am regarded with affection, and should seem able to speak, and yet should not venture to write, is the mark of a man guilty of extreme idleness, and, at the same time, inflicting punishment on himself.

[337:7] For it is clear that you will requite my poor little letter with a fine large one, and will take care not to wrong me again.

[337:8] At this word, I fancy, many will cry out, and will crowd round with the shout, What! has Basil done any wrong—even a small wrong? Then so have oeacus, and Minos and his brother.

[337:9] In other points I admit that you have won.

[337:10] Who ever saw you that does not envy you? But in one thing you have sinned against me; and, if I remind you of it, induce those who are indignant thereat not to make a public outcry.

[337:11] No one has ever come to you and asked a favour which it was easy to give, and gone away unsuccessful.

[337:12] But I am one of those who have craved a boon without receiving it.

[337:13] What then did I ask? Often when I was with you in camp, I was desirous of entering, with the aid of your wisdom, into the depth of Homer's frenzy.

[337:14] If the whole is impossible, I said, do you bring me to a portion of what I want.

[337:15] I was anxious for a part, wherein, when things have gone ill with the Greeks, Agamemnon courts with gifts the man whom he has insulted.

[337:16] When I so spoke, you laughed, because you could not deny that you could if you liked, but were unwilling to give.

[337:17] Do I really seem to be wronged to you and to your friends, who were indignant at my saying that you were doing a wrong?.

[338:1] Letter CCCXLVI.

[338:2] Libanius to Basil.

[338:3] You yourself will judge whether I have added anything in the way of learning to the young men whom you have sent.

[338:4] I hope that this addition, however little it be, will get the credit of being great, for the sake of your friendship towards me.

[338:5] But inasmuch as you give less praise to learning than to temperance and to a refusal to abandon our souls to dishonourable pleasures, they have devoted their main attention to this, and have lived, as indeed they ought, with due recollection of the friend who sent them hither.

[338:6] So welcome what is your own, and give praise to men who by their mode of life have done credit both to you and to me.

[338:7] But to ask you to be serviceable to them is like asking a father to be serviceable to his children.

[339:1] Letter CCCXLVII.

[339:2] Libanius to Basil.

[339:3] Every bishop is a thing out of which it is very hard to get anything.

[339:4] The further you have advanced beyond other people in learning, the more you make me afraid that you will refuse what I ask.

[339:5] I want some rafters.

[339:6] Any other sophist would have called them stakes, or poles, not because he wanted stakes or poles, but rather for shewing off his wordlets than out of any real need.

[339:7] If you do not supply them, I shall have to winter in the open air.

[340:1] Letter CCCXLVIII.

[340:2] Basil to Libanius.

[340:3] If γριπίζειν is the same thing as to gain, and this is the meaning of the phrase which your sophistic ingenuity has got from the depths of Plato, consider, my dear sir, who is the more hard to be got from, I who am thus impaled by your epistolary skill, or the tribe of Sophists, whose craft is to make money out of their words.

[340:4] What bishop ever imposed tribute by his words? What bishop ever made his disciples pay taxes? It is you who make your words marketable, as confectioners make honey-cakes.

[340:5] See how you have made the old man leap and bound! However, to you who make such a fuss about your declamations, I have ordered as many rafters to be supplied as there were fighters at Thermopylae, all of goodly length, and, as Homer has it, "long-shadowing," which the sacred Alphaeus has promised to restore.

[341:1] Letter CCCXLIX.

[341:2] Libanius to Basil.

[341:3] Will you not give over, Basil, packing this sacred haunt of the Muses with Cappadocians, and these redolent of the frost and snow and all Cappadocia's good things? They have almost made me a Cappadocian too, always chanting their "I salute you".

[341:4] I must endure, since it is Basil who commands.

[341:5] Know, however, that I am making a careful study of the manners and customs of the country, and that I mean to metamorphose the men into the nobility and the harmony of my Calliope, that they may seem to you to be turned from pigeons into doves.

[342:1] Letter CCCL.

[342:2] Basil to Libanius.

[342:3] Your annoyance is over.

[342:4] Let this be the beginning of my letter.

[342:5] Go on mocking and abusing me and mine, whether laughing or in earnest.

[342:6] Why say anything about frost or snow, when you might be luxuriating in mockery? For my part, Libanius, that I may rouse you to a hearty laugh, I have written my letter enveloped in a snow-white veil.

[342:7] When you take the letter in your hand, you will feel how cold it is, and how it symbolizes the condition of the sender—kept at home and not able to put head out of doors.

[342:8] For my house is a grave till spring comes and brings us back from death to life, and once more gives to us, as to plants, the boon of existence.

[343:1] Letter CCCLI.

[343:2] Basil to Libanius.

[343:3] Many, who have come to me from where you are, have admired your oratorical power.

[343:4] They were remarking that there has been a very brilliant specimen of this, and a very great contest, as they alleged, with the result that all crowded together, and no one appeared in the whole city but Libanius alone in the lists, and everybody, young and old, listening.

[343:5] For no one was willing to be absent—not a man of rank—not a distinguished soldier—not an artisan.

[343:6] Even women hurried to be present at the struggle.

[343:7] And what was it? What was the speech which brought together this vast assembly? I have been told that it contained a description of a man of peevish temper.

[343:8] Pray lose no time in sending me this much admired speech, in order that I too may join in praising your eloquence.

[343:9] If I am a praiser of Libanius without his works, what am I likely to become after receiving the grounds on which to praise him?.

[344:1] Letter CCCLII.

[344:2] Libanius to Basil.

[344:3] Behold! I have sent you my speech, all streaming with sweat as I am! How should I be otherwise, when sending my speech to one who by his skill in oratory is able to shew that the wisdom of Plato and the ability of Demosthenes were belauded in vain? I feel like a gnat compared with an elephant.

[344:4] How I shiver and shake, as I reckon up the day when you will inspect my performance I am almost out of my wits!.

[345:1] Letter CCCLIII.

[345:2] Basil to Libanius.

[345:3] I have read your speech, and have immensely admired it.

[345:4] O muses; O learning; O Athens; what do you not give to those who love you! What fruits do not they gather who spend even a short time with you! Oh for your copiously flowing fountain! What men all who drink of it are shewn to be! I seemed to see the man himself in your speech, in the company of his chattering little woman.

[345:5] A living story has been written on the ground by Libanius, who alone has bestowed the gift of life upon his words.

[346:1] Letter CCCLIV.

[346:2] Libanius to Basil.

[346:3] Now I recognise men's description of me! Basil has praised me, and I am hailed victor over all! Now that I have received your vote, I am entitled to walk with the proud gait of a man who haughtily looks down on all the world.

[346:4] You have composed an oration against drunkenness.

[346:5] I should like to read it.

[346:6] But I am unwilling to try to say anything clever.

[346:7] When I have seen your speech it will teach me the art of expressing myself.

[347:1] Letter CCCLV.

[347:2] Libanius to Basil.

[347:3] Are you living at Athens, Basil? Have you forgotten yourself? The sons of the Caesareans could not endure to hear these things.

[347:4] My tongue was not accustomed to them.

[347:5] Just as though I were treading some dangerous ground, and were struck at the novelty of the sounds, it said to me its father, "My father, you never taught this! This man is Homer, or Plato, or Aristotle, or Susarion.

[347:6] He knows everything".

[347:7] So far my tongue.

[347:8] I only wish, Basil, that you could praise me in the same manner!.

[348:1] Letter CCCLVI.

[348:2] Basil to Libanius.

[348:3] I am delighted at receiving what you write, but when you ask me to reply, I am in a difficulty.

[348:4] What could I say in answer to so Attic a tongue, except that I confess, and confess with joy, that I am a pupil of fishermen?.

[349:1] Letter CCCLVII.

[349:2] Libanius to Basil.

[349:3] What has made Basil object to the letter, the proof of philosophy? I have learned to make fun from you, but nevertheless your fun is venerable and, so to say, hoary with age.

[349:4] But, by our very friendship, by our common pastimes, do away, I charge you, with the distress caused by your letter…in nothing differing.

[350:1] Letter CCCLVIII.

[350:2] Libanius to Basil.

[350:3] Oh, for the old days in which we were all in all to one another! Now we are sadly separated! Ye have one another, I have no one like you to replace you.

[350:4] I hear that Alcimus in his old age is venturing on a young man's exploits, and is hurrying to Rome, after imposing on you the labour of remaining with the lads.

[350:5] You, who are always so kind, will not take this ill.

[350:6] You were not even angry with me for having to write first.

[351:1] Letter CCCLIX.

[351:2] Basil to Libanius.

[351:3] You, who have included all the art of the ancients in your own mind, are so silent, that you do not even let me get any gain in a letter.

[351:4] I, if the art of Daedalus had only been safe, would have made me Icarus' wings and come to you.

[351:5] But wax cannot be entrusted to the sun, and so, instead of Icarus' wings, I send you words to prove my affection.

[351:6] It is the nature of words to indicate the love of the heart.

[351:7] So far, words.

[351:8] You do with them what you will, and, possessing all the power you do, are silent.

[351:9] But pray transfer to me the fountains of words that spring from your mouth.

[352:1] Letter CCCLX.

[352:2] Of the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation, the invocation of Saints, and their Images.

[352:3] According to the blameless faith of the Christians which we have obtained from God, I confess and agree that I believe in one God the Father Almighty; God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost; I adore and worship one God, the Three.

[352:4] I confess to the oeconomy of the Son in the flesh, and that the holy Mary, who gave birth to Him according to the flesh, was Mother of God.

[352:5] I acknowledge also the holy apostles, prophets, and martyrs; and I invoke them to supplication to God, that through them, that is, through their mediation, the merciful God may be propitious to me, and that a ransom may be made and given me for my sins.

[352:6] Wherefore also I honour and kiss the features of their images, inasmuch as they have been handed down from the holy apostles, and are not forbidden, but are in all our churches.

[352:7] Letters CCCLXI.

[352:8] and CCCLXIII.

[352:9] , to Apollinarius, and Letters CCCLXII.

[352:10] and CCCLXIV.

[352:11] , from Apollinarius to Basil, are condemned as indubitably spur.

[353:1] ious, not only on internal evidence, but also on the ground of Basil's asseveration that he had never written but once to Apollinarius, and that "as layman to layman".

[353:2] Letter CCCLXV.

[353:3] , "to the great emperor Theodosius," on an inundation in Cappadocia, is also condemned by the Ben.

[353:4] Ed.

[353:5] as spurious, and contains nothing of ecclesiastical or theological interest.

[353:6] Tillemont however (vol.

[353:7] v.

[353:8] , p.

[353:9] 739) thought its style not unworthy of a young man and a rhetorician, and conjectures the Theodosius to whom it is addressed to be not the great emperor, but some magistrate of Cappadocia.

[354:1] Letter CCCLXVI.

[354:2] Basil to Urbicius the monk, concerning continency.

[354:3] You do well in making exact definitions for us, so that we may recognise not only continency, but its fruit.

[354:4] Now its fruit is the companionship of God.

[354:5] For not to be corrupted, is to have part with God; just as to be corrupted is the companionship of the world.

[354:6] Continency is denial of the body, and confession to God.

[354:7] It withdraws from anything mortal, like a body which has the Spirit of God.

[354:8] It is without rivalry and envy, and causes us to be united to God.

[354:9] He who loves a body envies another.

[354:10] He who has not admitted the disease of corruption into his heart, is for the future strong enough to endure any labour, and though he have died in the body, he lives in incorruption.

[354:11] Verily, if I rightly apprehend the matter, God seems to me to be continency, because He desires nothing, but has all things in Himself.

[354:12] He reaches after nothing, nor has any sense in eyes or ears; wanting nothing, He is in all respects complete and full.

[354:13] Concupiscence is a disease of the soul; but continency is its health.

[354:14] And continency must not be regarded only in one species, as, for instance, in matters of sensual love.

[354:15] It must be regarded in everything which the soul lusts after in an evil manner, not being content with what is needful for it.

[354:16] Envy is caused for the sake of gold, and innumerable wrongs for the sake of other lusts.

[354:17] Not to be drunken is continency.

[354:18] Not to overeat one's self is continency.

[354:19] To subdue the body is continency, and to keep evil thoughts in subjection, whenever the soul is disturbed by any fancy false and bad, and the heart is distracted by vain cares.

[354:20] Continency makes men free, being at once a medicine and a power, for it does not teach temperance; it gives it.

[354:21] Continency is a grace of God.

[354:22] Jesus seemed to be continency, when He was made light to land and sea; for He was carried neither by earth nor ocean, and just as He walked on the sea, so He did not weigh down the earth.

[354:23] For if death comes of corruption, and not dying comes of not having corruption, then Jesus wrought not mortality but divinity.

[354:24] He ate and drank in a peculiar manner, without rendering his food.

[354:25] So mighty a power in Him was continency, that His food was not corrupted in Him, since He had no corruption.

[354:26] If only there be a little continency in us, we are higher than all.

[354:27] We have been told that angels were ejected from heaven because of concupiscence and became incontinent.

[354:28] They were vanquished; they did not come down.

[354:29] What could that plague have effected there, if an eye such as I am thinking of had been there? Wherefore I said, If we have a little patience, and do not love the world, but the life above, we shall be found there where we direct our mind.

[354:30] For it is the mind, apparently, which is the eye that seeth unseen things.

[354:31] For we say "the mind sees;" "the mind hears".

[354:32] I have written at length, though it may seem little to you.

[354:33] But there is meaning in all that I have said, and, when you have read it, you will see it.
