# Eusebius: Church History

[1:1] Chapter III  Eusebius' Church History.

[1:2] §.

[1:3] Date of its Composition  The work with which we are especially concerned at this time is the Church History, the original Greek of which is still extant in numerous mss.

[1:4] It consists of ten books, to which is added in most of the mss.

[1:5] the shorter form of the Martyrs of Palestine (see above, p.

[1:6] ).

[1:7] The date of the work can be determined with considerable exactness.

[1:8] It closes with a eulogy of Constantine and his son Crispus; and since the latter was put to death by his father in the summer of , the History must have been completed before that time.

[1:9] On the other hand, in the same chapter Eusebius refers to the defeat of Licinius, which took place in the year  a.

[1:10] d.

[1:11] This gives a fixed terminus a quo.

[1:12] It is not quite certain from Eusebius' words whether the death of Licinius had already taken place at the time he wrote, but it seems probable that it had, and if so, the completion of the work must be put as late as the summer of.

[1:13] On the other hand, not the slightest reference is made to the Council of Nicaea, which met in the summer of ; and still further the tenth book is dedicated to Paulinus, at one time bishop of Tyre and afterward bishop of Antioch (see Euseb.

[1:14] Contra Marc.

[1:15] I.

[1:16] , and Philost.

[1:17] H.

[1:18] E.

[1:19] III.

[1:20] ), who was already dead in the summer of : for at the Nicene Council, Zeno appears as bishop of Tyre, and Eustathius as bishop of Antioch (see for further particulars Lightfoot, p.

[1:21] ).

[1:22] We are thus led to place the completion of the History in the year , or, to give the widest possible limits, between the latter part of  and the early part of  a.

[1:23] d.

[1:24] But the question has been raised whether the earlier books may not have been composed some years before this.

[1:25] Lightfoot (following Westcott) supposes that the first nine books were completed not long after the edict of Milan and before the outbreak of the quarrel between Constantine and Licinius in.

[1:26] There is considerable to be said in favor of this theory.

[1:27] The language used in the dedication of the tenth book seems to imply that the nine books had been completed some time before, and that the tenth is added as a sort of postscript.

[1:28] The close of the ninth book strengthens that conclusion.

[1:29] Moreover, it would seem from the last sentences of that book that Constantine and Licinius were in perfect harmony at the time it was written, a state of affairs which did not exist after.

[1:30] On the other hand, it must be noticed that in Book IX.

[1:31] chap.

[1:32] Licinius' "madness" is twice referred to as having "not yet" seized him (in § οὔπω μανέντος τοτε, and in § οὔπω τότε ἐφ᾽ ἣν ὕστερον ἐκπέπτωκε μανίαν, τὴν δι€νοιαν ἐκτραπείς).

[1:33] It is necessary either to interpret both these clauses as later insertions (possibly by Eusebius' own hand at the time when he added the tenth book; cf.

[1:34] also p.

[1:35] , above), or to throw the composition of the ninth book down to the year  or later.

[1:36] It is difficult to decide between these alternatives, but I am inclined on the whole to think that Westcott's theory is probably correct, and that the two clauses can best be interpreted as later insertions.

[1:37] The very nature of his History would at any rate lead us to think that Eusebius spent some years in the composition of it, and that the earlier books, if not published, were at least completed long before the issue of the ten books as a whole.

[1:38] The Chronicle is referred to as already written in I.

[1:39] ; the Eclogae Proph.

[1:40] (? see below, p.

[1:41] ) in I.

[1:42] and ; the Collection of Ancient Martyrdoms in IV.

[1:43] , V.

[1:44] preface, , and ; the Defense of Origen in VI.

[1:45] , , and ; the Life of Pamphilus in VI.

[1:46] , VII.

[1:47] , and VIII.

[1:48] In VIII.

[1:49] Eusebius speaks also of his intention of relating the sufferings of the martyrs in another work (but see above, p.

[1:50] ).

[1:51] §.

[1:52] The Author's Design.

[1:53] That the composition of a history of the Church was Eusebius' own idea, and was not due to any suggestion from without, seems clear, both from the absence of reference to any one else as prompting it, and from the lack of a dedication at the beginning of the work.

[1:54] The reasons which led him to undertake its composition seem to have been both scientific and apologetic.

[1:55] He lived, and he must have realized the fact, at the opening of a new age in the history of the Church.

[1:56] He believed, as he frequently tells us, that the period of struggle had come to an end, and that the Church was now about entering upon a new era of prosperity.

[1:57] He must have seen that it was a peculiarly fitting time to put on record for the benefit of posterity the great events which had taken place within the Church during the generations that were past, to sum up in one narrative all the trials and triumphs which had now emerged in this final and greatest triumph, which he was witnessing.

[1:58] He wrote, as any historian of the present day would write, for the information and instruction of his contemporaries and of those who should come after, and yet there was in his mind all the time the apologetic purpose, the desire to exhibit to the world the history of Christianity as a proof of its divine origin and efficacy.

[1:59] The plan which he proposed to himself is stated at the very beginning of his work: "It is my purpose to write an account of the successions of the holy apostles, as well as of the times which have elapsed from the days of our Saviour to our own; and to relate how many and how important events are said to have occurred in the history of the Church; and to mention those who have governed and presided over the Church in the most prominent parishes, and those who in each generation have proclaimed the divine word either orally or in writing.

[1:60] It is my purpose also to give the names and the number and the times of those who through love of innovation have run into the greatest errors, and proclaiming themselves discoverers of knowledge, falsely so-called, have, like fierce wolves, unmercifully devastated the flock of Christ.

[1:61] It is my intention, moreover, to recount the misfortunes which immediately came upon the whole Jewish nation in consequence of their plots against our Saviour, and to record the ways and the times in which the divine word has been attacked by the Gentiles, and to describe the character of those who at various periods have contended for it in the face of blood and tortures, as well as the confessions which have been made in our own days, and finally the gracious and kindly succour which our Saviour afforded them all".

[1:62] It will be seen that Eusebius had a very comprehensive idea of what a history of the Church should comprise, and that he was fully alive to its importance.

[1:63] §.

[1:64] Eusebius as a Historian.

[1:65] The Merits and Defects of his History.

[1:66] The whole Christian world has reason to be thankful that there lived at the opening of the fourth century a man who, with his life spanning one of the greatest epochs that has occurred in the history of the Church, with an intimate experimental knowledge of the old and of the new condition of things, was able to conceive so grand a plan and possessed the means and the ability to carry it out.

[1:67] Had he written nothing else, Eusebius' Church History would have made him immortal; for if immortality be a fitting reward for large and lasting services, few possess a clearer title to it than the author of that work.

[1:68] The value of the History to us lies not in its literary merit, but in the wealth of the materials which it furnishes for a knowledge of the early Church.

[1:69] How many prominent figures of the first three centuries are known to us only from the pages of Eusebius; how many fragments, priceless on account of the light which they shed upon movements of momentous and far-reaching consequence, have been preserved by him alone; how often a hint dropped, a casual statement made in passing, or the mention of some apparently trifling event, gives the clue which enables us to unravel some perplexing labyrinth, or to fit into one whole various disconnected and apparently unrelated elements, and thus to trace the steps in the development of some important historical movement whose rise and whose bearing must otherwise remain an unsolved riddle.

[1:70] The work reveals no sympathy with Ebionism, Gnosticism, and Montanism, and little appreciation of their real nature, and yet our knowledge of their true significance and of their place in history is due in considerable part to facts respecting the movements or their leaders which Eusebius alone has recorded or preserved.

[1:71] To understand the development of the Logos Christology we must comprehend the significance of the teaching of Paul of Samosata, and how inadequate would our knowledge of the nature of that teaching be without the epistle quoted in Book VII.

[1:72] chap.

[1:73] How momentous were the consequences of the paschal controversies, and how dark would they be were it not for the light shed upon them by our author.

[1:74] How important, in spite of their tantalizing brevity and obscurity, the fragments of Papias' writings; how interesting the extracts from the memoirs of Hegesippus; how suggestive the meager notices from Dionysius of Corinth, from Victor of Rome, from Melito, from Caius; how instructive the long and numerous quotations from the epistles of Dionysius of Alexandria! He may often fail to appreciate the significance of the events which he records, he may in many cases draw unwarranted conclusions from the premises which he states, he may sometimes misinterpret his documents and misunderstand men and movements, but in the majority of cases he presents us with the material upon which to form our own judgments, and if we differ with him we must at the same time thank him for the data which have enabled us independently to reach other results.

[1:75] But the value of Eusebius' Church History does not lie solely in the fact that it contains so many original sources which would be otherwise unknown to us.

[1:76] It is not merely a thesaurus, it is a history in the truest sense, and it possesses an intrinsic value of its own, independent of its quotations from other works.

[1:77] Eusebius possessed extensive sources of knowledge no longer accessible to us.

[1:78] His History contains the results of his extended perusal of many works which are now irrecoverably lost, of his wide acquaintance with the current traditions of his day, of his familiar intercourse with many of the chief men of the age.

[1:79] If we cut out all the documents which he quotes, there still remains an extensive history whose loss would leave an irreparable blank in our knowledge of the early Church.

[1:80] How invaluable, for instance, to mention but one matter, are the researches of our author in regard to the circulation of the books of the New Testament: his testimony to the condition of the canon in his own time, and to the more or less widespread use of particular writings by the Fathers of preceding centuries.

[1:81] Great as is the value of the sources which Eusebius quotes, those that he does not give are still more extensive, and it is the knowledge gained from them which he has transmitted to us.

[1:82] The worth of these portions of his History must depend in the first place upon the extent and reliability of his sources, and in the second place upon the use which he made of them.

[1:83] A glance at the list of his authorities given in the index, reveals at once the immense range of his materials.

[1:84] The number of books which he either quotes or refers to as read is enormous.

[1:85] When to these are added the works employed by him in the composition of his Praep.

[1:86] Evang.

[1:87] , as well as the great number which he must have perused, but does not mention, we are amazed at the extent of his reading.

[1:88] He must have been a voracious reader from his earliest years, and he must have possessed extraordinary acquisitive powers.

[1:89] It is safe to say that there was among the Fathers, with the possible exception of Origen, no more learned man than he.

[1:90] He thus possessed one of the primary qualifications of the historian.

[1:91] And yet even in this respect he had his limitations.

[1:92] He seems to have taken no pains to acquaint himself with the works of heretics, but to have been content to take his knowledge of them at second hand.

[1:93] And still further, he was sadly ignorant of Latin literature and of the Latin Church in general (see below, p.

[1:94] ); in fact, we must not expect to glean from his History a very thorough or extended knowledge of western Christendom.

[1:95] But his sources were not confined to literary productions.

[1:96] He had a wide acquaintance with the world, and he was enabled to pick up much from his intercourse with other men and with different peoples that he could not have found upon the shelves of the Caesarean or of any other library.

[1:97] Moreover, he had access to the archives of state and gathered from them much information quite inaccessible to most men.

[1:98] He was thus peculiarly fitted, both by nature and by circumstances, for the task of acquiring material, the first task of the genuine historian.

[1:99] But the value of his work must depend in the second place upon the wisdom and honesty with which he used his sources, and upon the faithfulness and accuracy with which he reproduced the results thus reached.

[1:100] We are therefore led to enquire as to his qualifications for this part of his work.

[1:101] We notice, in the first place, that he was very diligent in the use of his sources.

[1:102] Nothing seems to have escaped him that might in any way bear upon the particular subject in hand.

[1:103] When he informs us that a certain author nowhere mentions a book or an event, he is, so far as I am aware, never mistaken.

[1:104] When we realize how many works he read entirely through for the sake of securing a single historical notice, and how many more he must have read without finding anything to his purpose, we are impressed with his untiring diligence.

[1:105] To-day, with our convenient indexes, and with the references at hand which have been made by many other men who have studied the writings of the ancients, we hardly comprehend what an amount of labor the production of a History like Eusebius' must have cost him, a pioneer in that kind of work.

[1:106] In the second place, we are compelled to admire the sagacity which our author displays in the selection of his materials.

[1:107] He possessed the true instinct of the historian, which enabled him to pick out the salient points and to present to the reader just that information which he most desires.

[1:108] We shall be surprised upon examining his work to see how little it contains which it is not of the utmost importance for the student of early Church history to know, and how shrewdly the author has anticipated most of the questions which such a student must ask.

[1:109] He saw what it was in the history of the first three centuries of the Church which posterity would most desire to know, and he told them.

[1:110] His wisdom in this respect is all the more remarkable when compared with the unwisdom of most of his successors, who filled their works with legends of saints and martyrs, which, however fascinating they may have been to the readers of that age, possess little either of interest or of value for us.

[1:111] When he wishes to give us a glimpse of the persecutions of those early days, his historical and literary instinct leads him to dwell especially upon two thoroughly representative cases,—the martyrdom of Polycarp and the sufferings of the churches of Lyons and Vienne,—and to preserve for posterity two of the noblest specimens of martyrological literature which the ancient Church produced.

[1:112] It is true that he sometimes erred in his judgment as to the wants of future readers; we could wish that he had been somewhat fuller and clearer on many points, and that he had not so entirely neglected some others; but on the whole I am of the opinion that few historical works, ancient or modern, have in the same compass better fulfilled their mission in this respect.

[1:113] In the third place, we can hardly fail to be impressed by the wisdom with which Eusebius discriminated between reliable and unreliable sources.

[1:114] Judged by the modern standard he may fall short as a literary critic, but judged by the standard of antiquity he must be given a very high rank.

[1:115] Few indeed are the historians of ancient times, secular or ecclesiastical, who can compare with Eusebius for sound judgment in this matter.

[1:116] The general freedom of his work from the fables and prodigies, and other improbable or impossible tales which disfigure the pages of the great majority even of the soberest of ancient historians, is one of its most marked features.

[1:117] He shows himself uncommonly particular in demanding good evidence for the circumstances which he records, and uncommonly shrewd in detecting spurious and unreliable sources.

[1:118] When we remember the great number of pseudonymous works which were current in his day we are compelled to admire his care and his discrimination.

[1:119] Not that he always succeeded in detecting the false.

[1:120] More than once he was sadly at fault (as for instance in regard to the Abgarus correspondence and Josephus' testimony to Christ), and has in consequence been severely denounced or held up to unsparing ridicule by many modern writers.

[1:121] But the wonder certainly is not that he erred as often as he did, but that he did not err oftener; not that he was sometimes careless in regard to the reliability of his sources, but that he was ever as careful as, in the majority of cases, he has proved himself to be.

[1:122] In fact, comparing him with other writers of antiquity, we cannot commend too highly the care and the skill with which he usually discriminated between the true and the false.

[1:123] In the fourth place, he deserves all praise for his constant sincerity and unfailing honesty.

[1:124] I believe that emphasis should be laid upon this point for the reason that Eusebius' reputation has often suffered sadly in consequence of the unjust imputations, and the violent accusations, which it was for a long time the fashion to make against him, and which lead many still to treat his statements with distrust, and his character with contempt.

[1:125] Gibbon's estimate of his honesty is well known and has been unquestioningly accepted in many quarters, but it is none the less unjust, and in its implications quite untrue to the facts.

[1:126] Eusebius does dwell with greater fullness upon the virtues than upon the vices of the early Church, upon its glory than upon its shame, and he tells us directly that it is his intention so to do (H.

[1:127] E.

[1:128] VIII.

[1:129] ), but he never undertakes to conceal the sins of the Christians, and the chapter immediately preceding contains a denunciation of their corruptness and wickedness uttered in no faint terms.

[1:130] In fact, in the face of these and other candid passages in his work, it is the sheerest injustice to charge him with dishonesty and unfairness because he prefers, as almost any Christian historian must, to dwell with greater fullness of detail upon the bright than upon the dark side of the picture.

[1:131] Scientific, Eusebius' method, in this respect, doubtless is not; but dishonest, no one has a right to call it.

[1:132] The most severe attack which has been made upon Eusebius in recent years is found in an article by Jachmann (see below, p.

[1:133] ).

[1:134] The evident animus which runs through his entire paper is very unpleasant; the conclusions which he draws are, to say the least, strained.

[1:135] I cannot enter here into a consideration of his positions; most of them are examined below in the notes upon the various passages which he discusses.

[1:136] The whole article, like most similar attacks, proceeds upon the supposition that our author is guilty, and then undertakes simply to find evidence of that which is already presupposed.

[1:137] I submit that few writers could endure such an ordeal.

[1:138] If Eusebius is tried according to the principles of common justice, and of sound literary criticism, I am convinced, after long and careful study, that his sincerity and honesty of purpose cannot be impeached.

[1:139] The particular instances which have been urged as proving his dishonesty will be discussed below in the notes upon the respective passages, and to those the reader is referred (compare especially pp.

[1:140] , , , , , , , ).

[1:141] Eusebius' critics are wont to condemn him severely for what they are pleased to call the dishonesty displayed by him in his Vita Constantini.

[1:142] Such critics forget, apparently, that that work pretends to be, not a history, but a panegyric.

[1:143] Judging it as such, I am unable to find anything in it which leads me to entertain for a moment a suspicion of the author's honesty.

[1:144] It is true that Eusebius emphasizes the Emperor's good qualities, and fails to mention the darker spots in his character; but so far as I am aware he misstates no facts, and does only what those who eulogize deceased friends are accustomed to do the world over.

[1:145] For a discussion of this matter the reader is referred to the prolegomena of Dr.

[1:146] Richardson, pp.

[1:147] sq.

[1:148] of this volume.

[1:149] I am pleased to learn from him that his study of the Vita has shown him nothing which justifies the charge of dishonesty brought against Eusebius.

[1:150] One of the most decisive marks of veracity upon the part of our author is the frankness with which he confesses his lack of knowledge upon any subject (cf.

[1:151] IV.

[1:152] ), and the care with which he distinguishes between the different kinds of evidence upon which he bases his statements.

[1:153] How frequently the phrases λόγος žχει, φασί, λέγεται, &c.

[1:154] , occur in connection with accounts which a less scrupulous historian would not hesitate to record as undoubted fact.

[1:155] How particular he is to mention his sources for any unusual or startling event.

[1:156] If the authorities seem to him quite inadequate, he simply omits all reference to an occurrence which most of his contemporaries and successors would have related with the greatest gusto; if the testimony seems to him strong, he records the circumstance and expressly mentions his authority, whether oral tradition, the testimony of eye-witnesses, or written accounts, and we are thus furnished the material from which to form our own judgments.

[1:157] He is often blamed by modern writers for what they are pleased to call his excessive credulity.

[1:158] Those who accuse him thus seem to forget that he lived in the fourth, not in the nineteenth century.

[1:159] That he believed many things which we now declare to be incredible is perfectly true, but that he believed things that other Christians of his day pronounced incredible is not true.

[1:160] Judged, in fact, according to the standard of his age—and indeed of eleven succeeding centuries—he must be pronounced remarkably free from the fault of over-credulity, in truth uncommonly skeptical in his attitude toward the marvelous.

[1:161] Not that he denies the occurrence of prodigies and wonders in his own and other ages, but that he always demands the strongest testimony before he allows himself to be convinced of their truth.

[1:162] Compare, e.

[1:163] g.

[1:164] , the care with which he gives his authorities for the anecdote in regard to the Thundering Legion (V.

[1:165] ), and his final suspension of judgment in the matter; compare also the emphasis which he lays upon the personal testimony of the Emperor in the matter of the appearance of the sign of the cross in the sky (Vita Const.

[1:166] I.

[1:167] sq.

[1:168] ), a phenomenon which he himself tells us that he would have believed upon no ordinary evidence.

[1:169] His conduct in this matter is a sign rather of a skepticism uncommon in his age than of an excessive and unusual credulity.

[1:170] Gibbon himself gives our author due credit in this respect, when he speaks of his character as "less tinctured with credulity, and more practiced in the arts of courts, than that of almost any of his contemporaries" (Decline and Fall, chap.

[1:171] XVI.

[1:172] ).

[1:173] On the other hand, Eusebius as an historian had many very grave faults which it is not my wish in the least to palliate or conceal.

[1:174] One of the most noticeable of these is his complete lack of any conception of historiography as a fine art.

[1:175] His work is interesting and instructive because of the facts which it records, but that interest is seldom if ever enhanced by his mode of presentation.

[1:176] There is little effective grouping, almost no sense of perspective, utter ignorance of the art of suggesting by a single line or phrase a finished picture of a man or of a movement.

[1:177] He was not, in other words, a Thucydides or a Tacitus; but the world has seen not many such as they.

[1:178] A second and still more serious fault is our author's want of depth, if I may so express myself, his failure to look beneath the surface and to grasp the real significance of things, to trace the influence of opinions and events.

[1:179] We feel this defect upon every page.

[1:180] We read the annals, but we are conscious of no masterful mind behind them, digesting and comprehending them into one organic and imposing whole.

[1:181] This radical weakness in our author's method is revealed perhaps most clearly in his superficial and transcendental treatment of heretics and heresies, his failure to appreciate their origin and their bearing upon the progress of Christian thought.

[1:182] Of a development in theology, in fact, he knows nothing, and hence his work lacks utterly that which we now look upon as the most instructive part of Church history,—the history of doctrine.

[1:183] In the third place, severe censure must be passed upon our author for his carelessness and inaccuracy in matters of chronology.

[1:184] We should expect that one who had produced the most extensive chronological work that had ever been given to the world, would be thoroughly at home in that province, but in truth his chronology is the most defective feature of his work.

[1:185] The difficulty is chiefly due to his inexcusable carelessness, we might almost say slovenliness, in the use of different and often contradictory sources of information.

[1:186] Instead of applying himself to the discrepancies, and endeavoring to reach the truth by carefully weighing the respective merits of the sources, or by testing their conclusions in so far as tests are possible, he adopts in many cases the results of both, apparently quite unsuspicious of the confusion consequent upon such a course.

[1:187] In fact, the critical spirit which actuates him in dealing with many other matters seems to leave him entirely when he is concerned with chronology; and instead of proceeding with the care and circumspection of an historian, he accepts what he finds with the unquestioning faith of a child.

[1:188] There is no case in which he can be convicted of disingenuousness, but at times his obtuseness is almost beyond belief.

[1:189] An identity of names, or a resemblance between events recorded by different authors, will often be enough to lead him all unconsciously to himself into the most absurd and contradictory conclusions.

[1:190] Instances of this may be seen in Book I.

[1:191] chap.

[1:192] , and in II.

[1:193] His confusion in regard to the various Antonines (see especially the note on the preface to Book V.

[1:194] ) is not at all unusual among the writers of his day, and in view of the frequent and perplexing use of the same names by the different emperors, might be quite excusable in a less scholarly man than Eusebius, but in his case it is evidence of unpardonable want of care.

[1:195] This serious defect in our author's method is not peculiar to him.

[1:196] Many historians, critical almost to a fault in most matters, accept the received chronology without question, and build upon it as if it were the surest of foundations.

[1:197] Such a consideration does not excuse Eusebius; it relieves him, however, of the stigma of peculiarity.

[1:198] Finally, the character of the History is greatly impaired by our author's desultory method.

[1:199] This is a characteristic of his literary work in general, and was referred to in the previous chapter.

[1:200] All his works are marred by it, but few suffer more noticeably than the History.

[1:201] The author does not confine himself as strictly as he should to the logical limits of the subject which he is treating, but allows himself to be led away from the main point by the suggestions that pour in upon him from all sides.

[1:202] As Lightfoot remarks, "We have not unfrequently to pick out from various parts of his work the notices bearing on one definite and limited subject.

[1:203] He relates a fact, or quotes an authority bearing upon it, in season or out of season, according as it is recalled to his memory by some accidental connexion".

[1:204] This unfortunate habit of Eusebius' is one into which men of wide learning are very apt to fall.

[1:205] The richness of their acquisitions embarrasses them, and the immense number of facts in their possession renders a comprehension of them all into one logical whole very difficult; and yet unless the facts be thus comprehended, unless they be thoroughly digested and arranged, the result is confusion and obscurity.

[1:206] To exclude is as necessary as to include, if one would write history with the highest measure of success; to exclude rigidly at one time what it is just as necessary to include at another.

[1:207] To men like Eusebius there is perhaps nothing more difficult than this.

[1:208] Only a mind as intensive as it is extensive, with a grasp as strong as its reach is wide, can accomplish it, and few are the minds that are blessed with both qualities.

[1:209] Few are the writers whose histories stand upon our shelves that fail not sadly in the one or in the other; and in few perhaps does the failure seem more marked than in our author.

[1:210] And yet, though it is apparent that the value of Eusebius' work is greatly impaired by its desultory method of treatment, I am confident that the defect is commonly exaggerated.

[1:211] The paragraph which Lightfoot quotes from Westcott on this subject leaves a false impression.

[1:212] Altogether too often our author introduces irrelevant matters, and repeats himself when repetition "mars the symmetry of his work"; and yet on the whole he follows a fairly well ordered plan with fairly good success.

[1:213] He endeavors to preserve a strictly chronological sequence in his arrangement of the books, and he adheres for the most part to his purpose.

[1:214] Though there may be disorder and confusion within the various periods, for instance within the apostolic age, the age of Trajan, of Hadrian, of the Antonines, &c.

[1:215] , yet the periods themselves are kept reasonably distinct from one another, and having finished his account of one of them the author seldom returns to it.

[1:216] Even in his treatment of the New Testament canon, which is especially desultory, he says most of what he has to say about it in connection with the apostles themselves, and before passing on to the second century.

[1:217] I would not overlook the exceeding flagrancy of his desultoriness and repetitiousness in his accounts of the writings of many of the Fathers, especially of the two Clements, and yet I would emphasize the fact that he certainly had an outline plan which he designed to follow, and for which due credit should be given him.

[1:218] He compares favorably in this respect with at least most of the writers of antiquity.

[1:219] Only with our modern method of dividing history into periods, separated by natural boundary lines, and of handling it under clearly defined rubrics, have we become able wholly to avoid the confused and illogical treatment of Eusebius and of others like him.

[1:222] The original Greek of Eusebius' History has been published in many editions.

[1:223] The editio princeps is that of Robert Stephanus, which appeared at Paris in , and again, with a few changes, and with the Latin translation of Christophorsonus and the notes of Suffridus Petrus, at Geneva in.

[1:224] Henr.

[1:225] Valesius (de Valois) published his first edition of the Greek text, with a new Latin translation and with copious critical and explanatory notes, at Paris in.

[1:226] His edition was reprinted at Mainz in , but the reprint is full of errors.

[1:227] In , after Valesius' death, a revised edition was issued at Paris, which in  was reprinted with some corrections at Amsterdam.

[1:228] In  Valesius' edition of Eusebius, together with his edition of Socrates, Sozomen, and the other Greek historians, was republished at Cambridge by William Reading, in three folio volumes.

[1:229] This is the best edition of Valesius, the commentary being supplemented by ms.

[1:230] notes which he had left among his papers, and increased by large additions from other writers under the head of Variorum.

[1:231] A reprint of Reading's edition was issued in –, but according to Heinichen it is not as accurate as that of.

[1:232] For the elucidation of Eusebius' History we owe more to Valesius than to any other man.

[1:233] His edition of the text was an immense advance upon that of Stephanus, and has formed the basis of all subsequent editions, while his notes are a perfect storehouse of information from which all annotators of Eusebius have extensively drawn.

[1:234] Migne's edition (Opera, II.

[1:235] –) is a reprint of Valesius' edition of.

[1:236] F.

[1:237] A.

[1:238] Stroth (Halle, ).

[1:239] A new edition of the Greek text, of which, however, only the first volume appeared, comprising Books I.

[1:240] -VII.

[1:241] E.

[1:242] Zimmermann (Frankfort-on-the-Main, ).

[1:243] A new edition of the Greek text, containing also the Latin translation of Valesius, and a few critical notes.

[1:244] F.

[1:245] A.

[1:246] Heinichen (Leipzig,  and ).

[1:247] An edition of the Greek text in three volumes, with a reprint of the entire commentary of Valesius, and with the addition of Variorum notes.

[1:248] The critical apparatus, printed in the third volume, is very meager.

[1:249] A few valuable excursuses close the work.

[1:250] Forty years later Heinichen published a second edition of the History in his Eusebii Pamphili Scripta Historica (Lips.

[1:251] –,  vols.

[1:252] ).

[1:253] The first volume contains the Greek text of the History, with valuable prolegomena, copious critical apparatus and very useful indices; the second volume contains the Vita Constantini, the Panegyricus or De laudibus Constantini, and Constantine's Oratio ad Sanctorum coetum, also accompanied with critical apparatus and indices; the third volume contains an extensive commentary upon the works included in the first two volumes, together with twenty-nine valuable excursuses.

[1:254] This entirely supersedes the first, and is on the whole the most complete and useful edition of the History which we have.

[1:255] The editor made diligent use of the labors of his predecessors, especially of Laemmer's.

[1:256] He did no independent work, however, in the way of collecting material for the criticism of the text, and was deficient in critical judgment.

[1:257] As a consequence his text has often to be amended on the basis of the variant readings, which he gives with great fullness.

[1:258] His commentary is made up largely of quotations from Valesius and other writers, and is valuable for the material it thus contains as well as for its references to other works.

[1:259] It labors under the same incompleteness, however, that mars Valesius' commentary, and, moreover, contains almost nothing of independent value.

[1:260] E.

[1:261] Burton (Oxford, ).

[1:262] The Greek text in two volumes, with the translation of Valesius and with critical apparatus; and again in , with the critical apparatus omitted, but with the notes of Valesius, Heinichen and others added.

[1:263] Burton made large contributions to the criticism of the text, and had he lived to superintend the issue of the second edition, would perhaps have succeeded in giving us a better text than any which we now possess, for he was a far more sagacious critic than Heinichen.

[1:264] As it is, his edition is marred by numerous imperfections, largely caused by the inaccuracy of those who collated mss.

[1:265] for him.

[1:266] His text, with the translation, notes, and critical apparatus omitted, was reprinted by Bright at Oxford in , and again in , in a single volume.

[1:267] This is a very handy edition, and for school use is unsurpassed.

[1:268] The typography is superb, and the admirable plan is followed of discarding quotation marks and printing all citations in smaller type, thus making plain to the eye at a glance what is Eusebius' own and what is another's.

[1:269] The text is preceded by a very interesting and graphic life of the historian.

[1:270] Schwegler (Tübingen, , in one volume).

[1:271] The Greek text with critical apparatus, but without translation and notes.

[1:272] An accurate and useful edition.

[1:273] Laemmer (Schaffhausen, –).

[1:274] The Greek text in one volume, with extensive critical apparatus, but without explanatory notes.

[1:275] Laemmer had unusual opportunities for collecting material, and has made larger additions to the critical apparatus than any one else.

[1:276] His edition was issued, however, in a most slovenly manner, and swarms with mistakes.

[1:277] Great care should therefore be exercised in the use of it.

[1:278] Finally must be mentioned the text of Dindorf (Lips.

[1:279] ), which is published in the Teubner series, and like most of the volumes of that series is handy and convenient, but of little value to the critical student.

[1:280] There are few writings of the Fathers which more sadly need and more richly deserve a new critical edition than the History of Eusebius.

[1:281] The material for the formation of a reliable text is extensive and accessible, but editors have contented themselves too much in the past with the results of their predecessors' labors, and unfortunately those labors have not always been accurate and thorough.

[1:282] As a consequence a new and more careful collation of most of the mss.

[1:283] of the original, together with those of Rufinus' translation, must lie at the foundation of any new work which is to be done in this line.

[1:284] The publication of the Syriac version will doubtless furnish much valuable material which the next editor of the History will be able to use to advantage.

[1:285] Anything less than such a thorough work as I have indicated will be of little worth.

[1:286] Unless the new edition be based upon extensive and independent labors, it will be little if any improvement upon that of Heinichen.

[1:287] It is to be hoped that a critical text, up to the standard of those of some other patristic works which we already possess, may yet be issued, which shall give us this, one of the noblest productions of the ancient Church, in a fitting and satisfactory form.

[1:288] Translations of Eusebius' History are very numerous.

[1:289] Probably the earliest of all is the ancient Syriac version which is preserved in great part in two mss.

[1:290] , one of which is at St.

[1:291] Petersburg and contains the entire History with the exception of Book VI.

[1:292] and large portions of Books V.

[1:293] and VII.

[1:294] The ms.

[1:295] is dated  a.

[1:296] d.

[1:297] (see Wright's description of it in his Catalogue of the Syriac mss.

[1:298] in the British Museum acquired since the year , Part III.

[1:299] p.

[1:300] xv.

[1:301] sq.

[1:302] ).

[1:303] The second ms.

[1:304] is in the British Museum, and contains Books I.

[1:305] –V.

[1:306] , with some mutilations at the beginning of the first book.

[1:307] The ms.

[1:308] dates from the sixth century (see Wright's description of it in his Catalogue, p.

[1:309] ).

[1:310] From these mss.

[1:311] Wright was engaged in preparing an edition of the Syriac, which remained unfinished at the time of his death.

[1:312] Whether he left his work in such shape that it can soon be issued by some one else I have not yet learned.

[1:313] The version was probably made at a very early date, possibly within the lifetime of Eusebius himself, though of that we can have no assurance.

[1:314] I understand that it confirms in the main the Greek text as now printed in our best editions.

[1:315] The original Latin version was made by Rufinus in the early years of the fifth century.

[1:316] He translated only nine books, and added to them two of his own, in which he brought the history down to the death of Theodosius the Great.

[1:317] He allowed himself his customary license in translating, and yet, although his version is by no means exact, it is one of our best sources for a knowledge of the true text of Eusebius, for it is possible, in many doubtful cases where our mss.

[1:318] are hopelessly divided, to ascertain from his rendering what stood in the original Greek.

[1:319] The version of Rufinus had a large circulation, and became in the Western Church a substitute for the original throughout the Middle Ages.

[1:320] It was first printed, according to Fabricius (ib.

[1:321] p.

[1:322] ), in  at Rome, afterward a great many times there and elsewhere.

[1:323] The first critical edition, which still remains the best, is that of Cacciari (Rome, ), which has become rare, and is very difficult to find.

[1:324] A new edition is a great desideratum.

[1:325] An important work upon Rufinus' version is Kimmel's De Rufino Eusebii Interprete, Gerae,.

[1:326] A new Latin translation, by Wolfgang Musculus, was published in Basle, in , and again in , , and , according to Fabricius (Bibl.

[1:327] Gr.

[1:328] VI.

[1:329] p.

[1:330] ).

[1:331] I have myself seen only the edition of.

[1:332] Still another Latin version, from the hand of Christophorsonus, was published at Louvain in.

[1:333] This is the only edition of Christophorsonus which I have seen, but I have notices of Cologne editions of ,  and , and of a Paris edition of.

[1:334] According to Fabricius the Paris edition, and according to Brunnet the Cologne edition of , contain the notes of Suffridus Petrus.

[1:335] A revision of Christophorsonus' version is said by Crusè to have been published by Curterius, but I have not seen it, nor am I aware of its date.

[1:336] Another translation, by Grynaeus, was published at Basle in.

[1:337] This is the only edition of Grynaeus' version which I have seen, and I find in it no reference to an earlier one.

[1:338] I have been informed, however, that an edition appeared in.

[1:339] Hanmer seems to imply, in his preface, that Grynaeus' version is only a revision of that of Musculus, and if that were so we should have to identify the  edition with the  edition of Musculus mentioned by Fabricius (see above).

[1:340] I am able, however, to find no hint in Grynaeus' edition itself that his version is a revision of that of Musculus.

[1:341] The translation of Valesius, which was first published in  (see above), was a great improvement upon all that had preceded it, and has been many times reprinted in other editions of Eusebius, as well as in his own.

[1:342] The first German translation was published by Caspar Hedio.

[1:343] The date of publication is given by Fabricius as , but the copy which I have seen is dated , and contains no reference to an earlier edition.

[1:344] It comprises only nine books of Eusebius, supplemented by the two of Rufinus.

[1:345] The title runs as follows: Chronica, das ist: wahrhaftige Beschreibunge aller alten Christlichen Kirchen; zum ersten, die hist.

[1:346] eccles.

[1:347] Eusebii Pamphili Caesariensis, Eilff Bücher; zum andern, die hist.

[1:348] eccles.

[1:349] tripartita Sozomeni, Socratis und Theodoreti, Zwölff Bücher; zum dritten die hist.

[1:350] eccles.

[1:351] sampt andern treffenlichen Geschichten, die zuvor in Teutschef Sprache wenig gelesen sind, auch Zwölff Bücher.

[1:352] Von der Zeit an da die hist.

[1:353] eccles.

[1:354] tripartita aufhöret: das ist, von der jarzal an, vierhundert nach Christi geburt, biss auff das jar MDXLV, durch D.

[1:355] Caspar Hedion zu Strassburg verteutscht und zusamen getragen.

[1:356] Getruckt zu Franckfurt am Mayn, im jar.

[1:357] A second German translation of the entire History (with the exception of the Martyrs of Palestine, and the Oration on the Building of the Churches, X.

[1:358] ), together with the Life of Constantine, was published by F.

[1:359] A.

[1:360] Stroth in Quedlinburg in , in two volumes.

[1:361] Stroth prefaced the translation with a very valuable Life of Eusebius, and added a number of excellent notes of his own.

[1:362] The translation is reasonably accurate.

[1:363] A much more elegant German version (including the Oration, but omitting the Martyrs of Palestine) was published by Closs in Stuttgart in , in one volume.

[1:364] This is in my opinion the best translation of the History that exists.

[1:365] Its style is admirable, but pure German idiom is sometimes secured at the expense of faithfulness.

[1:366] In fact the author has aimed to produce a free, rather than a literal translation, and has occasionally allowed himself to depart too far from the original.

[1:367] A few brief notes, most of them taken from Valesius or Stroth, accompany the translation.

[1:368] More recently a German translation has been published by Stigloher (Kempten, ) in the Kempten Bibliothek der Kirchenväter.

[1:369] It purports to be a new translation, but is practically nothing more than a poorly revised edition of Closs' version.

[1:370] The changes which are made are seldom improvements.

[1:371] Fabricius mentions a French translation by Claudius Seysselius, but does not give the date of it, and I have not myself seen it.

[1:372] Dr.

[1:373] Richardson, however, informs me that he has a copy of this translation (which is from the Latin, not from the Greek) bearing the following title: L'Histoire ecclesiastique translatie de Latin au Français, par M.

[1:374] Claude de Seyssel, evesque lors de Marseille, et depuis archevesque de Thurin.

[1:375] Paris,  [or '], fº.

[1:376] He informs me also that there exist editions of the years  and.

[1:377] More than a century later appeared a new French translation by Louis Cousin, bearing the following title: Histoire de l'Eglise écrité par Eusèbe Césarée, Socrate, Sozomène, Theodoret et Evagre, avec l'abrégé de Philostorge par Photius, et de Théodore par Nicephore Calliste.

[1:378] Paris, –.

[1:379] vol.

[1:380] º.

[1:381] Another edition appeared in Holland in ,  vol.

[1:382] º.

[1:383] The first English translation was made by Hanmer, and was issued in , and, according to Crusè, passed through five editions.

[1:384] The fourth edition, which lies before me, was published in London in.

[1:385] The volume contains the Histories of Eusebius, of Socrates, and of Evagrius; Dorotheus' Lives, and Eusebius' Life of Constantine.

[1:386] Another translation is said by Crusè to have been published about a century later by T.

[1:387] Shorting, and to be a decided improvement upon that of Hanmer.

[1:388] I have seen no copy bearing Shorting's name, but have examined an anonymous translation which bears the following title: The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus in ten books.

[1:389] Made into English from that edition set forth by Valesius, and printed at Paris in the year ; together with Valesius' notes on the said historian, which are done into English and set at their proper place in the margin.

[1:390] Hereto also is annexed an account of the life and writings of the aforesaid historian, collected by Valesius and rendered into English.

[1:391] Cambridge: John Hayes,.

[1:392] This is evidently the translation of Shorting referred to by Crusè, for it answers perfectly the description which he gives of it.

[1:393] An abridgment of this version, made by Parker, is mentioned both by Fabricius (ib.

[1:394] p.

[1:395] ) and by Crusè, but I have not myself seen it.

[1:396] Fabricius gives its date as , and Dr.

[1:397] Richardson informs me that he has seen an edition bearing the date , and that he has a note of another published in  or.

[1:398] The latest English translation was made by the Rev.

[1:399] C.

[1:400] F.

[1:401] Crusè, an American Episcopalian of German descent, and was published first in Philadelphia in , with a translation, by Parker, of Valesius' Life of Eusebius prefixed.

[1:402] It has been reprinted a great many times both in England and America, and is included in Bohn's Ecclesiastical Library.

[1:403] In Bohn's edition are printed a few scattered notes from Valesius' commentary, and in some other editions an historical account of the Council of Nicaea, by Isaac Boyle, is added.

[1:404] The translation is an improvement upon its predecessors, but is nevertheless very faulty and unsatisfactory.

[1:405] The translator is not thoroughly at home in the English, and, moreover, his version is marred by many serious omissions and interpolations which reveal an inexcusable degree of carelessness on his part.

[1:406] §.

[1:407] Literature.

[1:408] The literature upon Eusebius' History is very extensive.

[1:409] Many of the editions already mentioned discuss, in their prolegomena, the History itself and Eusebius' character as a historian, as do also all the lives of Eusebius referred to above, and all the larger histories of the Church.

[1:410] In addition to these we have numerous important monographs and essays, of which the following may be mentioned here: Möller, de Fide Eusebii in rebus christianis enarrandis, Havn.

[1:411] ; Danz, de Eusebio Caesariensi Hist.

[1:412] Ecclesiasticae Scriptore, Jenae,.

[1:413] This was mentioned in Chapter I.

[1:414] as containing a valuable discussion of the life of Eusebius.

[1:415] Its chief importance lies in its treatment of the sources of the Church History, to which the author devotes the whole of Chap.

[1:431] Burckhardt, Zeit Constantins, d ed.

[1:432] , pp.

[1:433] sq.

[1:434] Burckhardt depreciates Eusebius' value and questions his veracity.

[1:435] The review articles that have been written on Eusebius' History are legion.

[1:436] I shall mention only Engelhardt's Eusebius als Kirchengeschichtschreiber, in the Zeitschrift für hist.

[1:437] Theol.

[1:438] , pp.

[1:439] –; and Jachmann's Bemerkungen über die Kirchengeschichte des Eusebius, ib.

[1:440] , II.

[1:441] pp.

[1:442] –.

[1:443] The latter contains one of the most unsparing attacks upon Eusebius' honesty that has ever been made (see above, p.

[1:444] ).
