# Gregory of Nazianzen: To Nicobulus

[1:1] 8.

[1:2] To Nicobulus.

[1:3] (See the introduction to the first letter to Sophronius above.

[1:4] )  Ep.

[1:5] XII.

[1:6] (About a.

[1:7] d.

[1:8] 365).

[1:9] You joke me about Alypiana as being little and unworthy of your size, you tall and immense and monstrous fellow both in form and strength.

[1:10] For now I understand that soul is a matter of measure, and virtue of weight, and that rocks are more valuable than pearls, and crows more respectable than nightingales.

[1:11] Well, well! rejoice in your bigness and your cubits, and be in no respect inferior to the famed sons of Aloeus.

[1:12] You ride a horse, and shake a spear, and concern yourself with wild beasts.

[1:13] But she has no such work; and no great strength is needed to carry a comb, or to handle a distaff, or to sit by a loom, "For such is the glory of woman".

[1:14] And if you add this, that she has become fixed to the ground on account of prayer, and by the great movement of her mind has constant communion with God, what is there here to boast of in your bigness or the stature of your body? Take heed to seasonable silence: listen to her voice: mark her unadornment, her womanly virility, her usefulness at home, her love of her husband.

[1:15] Then you will say with the Laconian, that verily soul is not a subject for measure, and the outer must look to the inner man.

[1:16] If you look at the things in this way you will leave off joking and deriding her as little, and you will congratulate yourself on your marriage.

[1:17] Ep.

[1:18] LI.

[1:19] (An answer to a request made by Nicobulus for a treatise on the art of writing letters.

[1:20] Benoît thinks this and the following ones were written to the Younger Nicobulus.

[1:21] )  Of those who write letters, since this is what you ask, some write at too great a length, and others err on the side of deficiency; and both miss the mean, like archers shooting at a mark and sending some shafts short of it and others beyond it; for the missing is the same though on opposite sides.

[1:22] Now the measure of letters is their usefulness: and we must neither write at very great length when there is little to say, nor very briefly when there is a great deal.

[1:23] What? Are we to measure our wisdom by the Persian Schoene, or by the cubits of a child, and to write so imperfectly as not to write at all but to copy the midday shadows, or lines which meet right in front of you, whose lengths are foreshortened and which show themselves in glimpses rather than plainly, being recognized only by certain of their extremities? We must in both respects avoid the want of moderation and hit off the moderate.

[1:24] This is my opinion as to brevity; as to perspicuity it is clear that one should avoid the oratorical form as much as possible and lean rather to the chatty: and, to speak concisely, that is the best and most beautiful letter which can convince either an unlearned or an educated reader; the one, as being within the reach of the many; the other, as above the many; and it should be intelligible in itself.

[1:25] It is equally disagreeable to think out a riddle and to have to interpret a letter.

[1:26] The third point about a letter is grace: and this we shall safeguard if we do not write in any way that is dry and unpleasing or unadorned and badly arranged and untrimmed, as they call it; as for instance a style destitute of maxims and proverbs and pithy sayings, or even jokes and enigmas, by which language is sweetened.

[1:27] Yet we must not seem to abuse these things by an excessive employment of them.

[1:28] Their entire omission shews rusticity, but the abuse of them shews insatiability.

[1:29] We may use them about as much as purple is used in woven stuffs.

[1:30] Figures of speech we shall admit, but few and modest.

[1:31] Antitheses and balanced clauses and nicely divided sentences, we shall leave to the sophists, or if we do sometimes admit them, we shall do so rather in play than in earnest.

[1:32] My final remark shall be one which I heard a clever man make about the eagle, that when the birds were electing a king, and came with various adornment, the most beautiful point about him was that he did not think himself beautiful.

[1:33] This point is to be especially attended to in letter-writing, to be without adventitious ornament and as natural as possible.

[1:34] So much about letters I send you by a letter; but perhaps you had better not apply it to myself, who am busied about more important matters.

[1:35] The rest you will work out for yourself, as you are quick at learning, and those who are clever in these matters will teach you.

[1:36] Ep.

[1:37] LII.

[1:38] (Nicobulus asked Gregory to publish a collection of his letters.

[1:39] Gregory forwards a copy.

[1:40] )  You are asking flowers from an autumn meadow, and arming Nestor in his old age, in demanding from me now something clever in the way of language, after I have long neglected all that is enjoyable in language and in life.

[1:41] But yet (since it is not an Eurysthean or Herculean labour that you are imposing on me, but rather one which is very agreeable and quiet, to collect for you as many of my own letters as I can), do you place this volume among your books—a work not amatory but oratorical, and not for display so much as for use, and that for our own home.

[1:42] For different authors have different characteristics, greater or smaller.

[1:43] Mine is a tendency to instruct by maxims and positive statements wherever opportunity occurs.

[1:44] And as in a legitimate child, so also in language, the father is always visible, not less than parents are shewn by bodily characteristics.

[1:45] Mine are such as I have mentioned.

[1:46] You may repay me both by writing and by deriving profit from what I have written.

[1:47] I cannot ask for or request any better reward than this, either more profitable to the asker, or more becoming him who gives it.

[1:48] Ep.

[1:49] LIII.

[1:50] (Gregory put a collection of Basil's letters with his own, and gave them the first place.

[1:51] Nicobulus seems to have been surprised at this, and asked the reason.

[1:52] Gregory explains as follows.

[1:53] )  I have always preferred the Great Basil to myself, though he was of the contrary opinion; and so I do now, not less for truth's sake than for friendship's.

[1:54] This is the reason why I have given his letters the first place and my own the second.

[1:55] For I hope we two will always be coupled together; and also I would supply others with an example of modesty and submission.

[1:56] Ep.

[1:57] LIV.

[1:58] On Laconicism.

[1:59] To be laconic is not merely, as you suppose, to write few words, but to say a great deal in few words.

[1:60] Thus I call Homer very brief and Antimachus lengthy.

[1:61] Why? Because I measure the length by the matter and not by the letters.

[1:62] Ep.

[1:63] LV.

[1:64] An Invitation.

[1:65] You flee when I pursue you: perhaps in accordance with the laws of love, to make yourself more valuable.

[1:66] Come then, and fill up at last the loss I have suffered by your long delay.

[1:67] And if any home affairs detain you, you shall leave us again, and so make yourself more precious as an object of desire.
