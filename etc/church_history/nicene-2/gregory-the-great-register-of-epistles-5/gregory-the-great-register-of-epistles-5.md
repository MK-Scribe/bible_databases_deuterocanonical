# Gregory The Great: Register of Epistles V

[1:1] Book V.

[2:1] Epistle II.

[2:2] To Felix, Bishop, and Cyriacus, Abbot.

[2:3] Gregory to Felix, &c.

[2:4] The tenor of the report submitted to you sufficiently explains the complaint of the religious lady Theodosia, in which we have found on reading it many heads of accusation, not befitting priestly gentleness, against our brother and fellow-bishop Januarius; so much so that, after the foundation by her of a monastery for servants of God, all that pertains to avarice, turbulence, and wrong is said to have been exhibited at the time of the very dedication of the oratory.

[2:5] Wherefore, if the case is as we find in her aforesaid representation, and if you are aware that anything at all unbecoming has been committed besides, we exhort you that, all wrongs having first been redressed, you press upon Musicus, the abbot of the monastery of Agilitanus, that he lose no time in giving the greatest attention to his monks whom he had began to settle there, to the end that, this venerable place being with the Lord's help set in order by you in a decent and regular manner, neither may we be disturbed by the frequent complaints of the aforesaid religious lady that her good desires are not fulfilled, nor may it be to the detriment of your soul that so pious a design should languish, as we do not believe it will, through any neglect of yours.

[3:1] Epistle IV.

[3:2] To Constantius, Bishop.

[3:3] Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of Mediolanum (Milan).

[3:4] If licence to be restored to their rank be granted to the lapsed, the force of ecclesiastical discipline is undoubtedly broken, while in the hope of restoration each person fears not to give way to his evil inclinations.

[3:5] Your Fraternity, for instance, has consulted us as to whether Amandinus, ex-presbyter and ex-abbot, who was deposed by your predecessor for fault requiring it, should be called back to his rank; which thing is not allowable; and we decree that it cannot on any account be done.

[3:6] Yet, if it should be the case that his manner of life deserves it, seeing that he has been deprived altogether of his sacred office, assign him a place in a monastery, as you may see fit, before other monks.

[3:7] Above all things, then, take care that no one's supplication persuade you in any way to restore the lapsed to their sacred orders, lest such punishment should be supposed not to be definitely ordained for them, but only a temporary expedient.

[3:8] As to Vitalianus the ex-presbyter, about whom you write that he should be strictly guarded, we will cause him to be sent into Sicily, that, being deprived of all hope of departure thence, he may then at least constrain himself to penitential bewailing.

[3:9] Jobinus also, of Portus Veneris, once deacon and abbot, we have decreed to be deprived of his office, and written that another should be ordained in his place.

[3:10] In like manner also we decree that the three subdeacons, whom your Fraternity has notified to us as having lapsed, shall ever cease from and stand deprived of their office, and that nothing beyond lay communion be allowed them.

[3:11] Further, we have adjudged the ex-presbyter Saturninus to give security that he will not ever presume to approach the ministry of his sacred order.

[3:12] And we desire him to remain, with deprivation of his sacred order, in the same island in which he was, permitting him to have and exercise care and solicitude with respect to monasteries; for we believe that, his lapse having made him more wary, he will now the more carefully keep guard over those who are committed to him.

[3:13] Further, concerning John, notary of your church, the charity wherewith we love you and have long loved you warns us to write, lest you should order anything with regard  to him while you are still provoked by his fault.

[3:14] Guarding, then, against this, enquire fully by all means in your power into the possessions of your church; by which means neither may you offend God, nor may he be able to find a ground for accusing you before men.

[3:15] For we write, not as defending John or commending him personally without reason, but lest your soul should be in any way burdened with sin under the incitement of anger.

[3:16] Whence it is needful, as we have before said, that you should by no means neglect to enquire, in the fear of God, with a full investigation into the possessions of your church.

[3:17] Furthermore, the epistle of your most dear Fraternity has caused us to wonder much with respect to the person of Fortunatus.

[3:18] But either that letter was not dictated by you, or certainly, if it is yours, we by no means recognize in it our brother the lord Constantius.

[3:19] For you ought to have paid, and still ought to pay, attention to the fact that it is in behalf of your reputation that we write.

[3:20] For, when he asserts that he suffers wrong among you, and has been unable to procure the guardian's (defensoris) aid, what else does he intimate but ill-will on your part? Wherefore, that neither this affair may dim your reputation in some quarters nor damage possibly ensue in any way with good cause to your church, you ought to send hither a person instructed by you, that the nature of the case may be examined, and the matter terminated, without ill-will on your part.

[3:21] And for this reason especially, that if, after his complaint, sentence should be pronounced among yourselves in your favour, he will be believed to have been defeated, not reasonably, but by power alone.

[3:22] But we, out of the charity wherewith we are bound to you, desist not from admonishing you to do what will be for your good repute, knowing that, though this exhortation saddens you for the time, it will afterwards cause you joy, when the animosity of contention has passed away.

[4:1] Epistle V.

[4:2] To Dominicus, Bishop.

[4:3] Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of Carthage.

[4:4] Prosper your delegate (responsalis), the bearer of these presents, has been with us, and after other expressions of your charity handed us your second letters with an allegation of the imperial commands, and a paper giving an account of the synod that has been held among you.

[4:5] Having read all, we rejoiced for your pastoral zeal, and that our most pious lords had given no ear to the calumnies of venal persons brought against you on the plea of religion; but especially that your Fraternity has so taken pains to preserve the African province as in no wise to neglect to restrain with priestly fervour the devious sects of heretics; concerning the quieting of whom we remember having laid down the law so fully, even before consulting the letters of your Charity, that we do not believe that anything needs to be said again in reply to you about them.

[4:6] Although, however, this is so, and though we desire all heretics to be repressed always with vigour and reason by catholic priests, yet, on looking thoroughly into what has been done among you, we are in fact apprehensive lest offence should thereby be caused (which thing may the Lord avert) to the primates of other councils.

[4:7] For at the conclusion of your acts you have promulged a sentence, in which, while ordering the searching out of those heretics, you have brought in that those who neglect the duty are to be punished by forfeiture of their possessions and dignities.

[4:8] It is therefore best, most dear brother, that, in dealing with matters outside ourselves that require correction, charity among ourselves should first be preserved, and that we should be subject in mind (as I judge to be peculiarly proper to your Gravity) even to persons below us in dignity.

[4:9] For you will then more advantageously meet the errors of heretics with your whole united powers when, as befits your priesthood, you study to keep ecclesiastical concord among yourselves.

[5:1] Epistle VIII.

[5:2] To Cyprian, Deacon.

[5:3] Gregory to Cyprian, deacon and rector of the patrimony of Sicily.

[5:4] Concerning the Manicheans who are on our possessions I have frequently admonished thy Love to press them with the utmost diligence, and recall them to the Catholic faith.

[5:5] If, then, the time requires it, make enquiries in person, or, if other business does not allow this, through others.

[5:6] Further, it has come to my ears that there are Hebrews on our possessions  who will not by any means be converted to God.

[5:7] But it seems to me that thou shouldest send letters through all our possessions on which these Hebrews are known to be, promising them particularly from me that whosoever of them shall have been converted to our true Lord God Jesus Christ shall have the burdens of his holding lightened.

[5:8] And this I wish to have done in such sort that, if one has a payment to make of one solidus, a third should be remitted him; if of three or four, that one solidus should be remitted; if of any more, the remission should still be made in the same proportion, or at any rate according as thy Love sees fit, so that one who is converted may have some relief of his burden, and the Church may not be put to heavy expense.

[5:9] Nor shall we do this unprofitably, if by lightening the burdens of their payments we bring them to the grace of Christ, since, though they themselves came with little faith, yet those who may be born of them will now be baptized with more faith: thus we gain either them or their children.

[5:10] And whatever amount of payment we let them off for the sake of Christ is nothing serious.

[5:11] Furthermore, some time ago, when John the deacon came, thy Love wrote something to me, the whole of which I read at the time, but let many days intervene before replying; and then, after such delay, replied to all particulars as I recollected them.

[5:12] But now I think that one point escaped my memory, and suspect that I gave no reply about it.

[5:13] For thou hadst written that loans were being advanced to peasants (rusticis) through certain undertakers for their debt, lest in borrowing from others they should be burdened either by exactions or by the prices of things.

[5:14] This particular was to me most acceptable; and, if indeed I have already written about it, observe what I wrote.

[5:15] But if, as I suspect, I gave in my reply no definite direction on the subject, thou must not hesitate to advance money for the advantage of the peasants, since the ecclesiastical property will not thus be wasted, and out of it the peasants will derive advantage.

[5:16] And, if there are other things which thou considerest to be advantageous, thou must carry them out without any hesitation.

[6:1] Epistle XI.

[6:2] To John, Bishop.

[6:3] Gregory to John, Bishop of Ravenna.

[6:4] I find that your Fraternity is greatly distressed on account of being forbidden by the censure of reason to wear the pallium in litanies.

[6:5] But through the most excellent Patrician, and through the most eminent Prefect, and through other noble men of your city, you have urgently requested to have this allowed you.

[6:6] Now we, having made careful enquiry of Adeodatus, some time thy Fraternity's deacon, have ascertained that it was never the custom of thy predecessors to use the pallium during litanies, except at the solemnities of the blessed John the Baptist, the blessed Apostle Peter, and the blessed martyr Apollinaris.

[6:7] But we were by no means bound to believe him, since many of our delegates have often been at your Fraternity's city, who declare that they never saw anything of the kind.

[6:8] And in this matter credence is rather to be given to many than to one, who is attesting something in behalf of his own Church.

[6:9] But, since we do not wish your Fraternity to be distressed, or the petition of our sons to be of no avail with us, we concede the use of the pallium, until we shall gain some more accurate knowledge, on the days of the Nativity of the Blessed John the Baptist, of the blessed Apostle Peter, and the blessed martyr Apollinaris, and on the day of the celebration of your ordination.

[6:10] But in the sacristy, according to former custom, after the sons of the Church have been received and dismissed, your Fraternity may put on the pallium, and so proceed to the solemnization of mass, arrogating to yourself nothing more in the daring of rash presumption; lest, while something is snatched at out of order in exterior habiliment, what might have been done in due order be neglected.

[6:11] Given in the month of October; Indiction 13.

[7:1] Epistle XV.

[7:2] To John, Bishop.

[7:3] Gregory to John, Bishop of Ravenna.

[7:4] In the first place this makes me sad; that thy Fraternity writes to me with a double heart, exhibiting one sort of blandishment in letters, but another sort with the tongue in secular intercourse.

[7:5] In the next place, it grieves me that my brother John even to this day retains on his tongue those gibes which notaries while still boys are wont to indulge in.

[7:6] He speaks bitingly, and seems to delight in such pleasantry.

[7:7] He flatters his friends in their presence, and maligns them in their absence.

[7:8] Thirdly, it is to me grievous and altogether execrable, that  he imputes shameful crimes to his servants, whatever the hour may be, calling them "effeminate;" and, what is still more grievous, this is done openly.

[7:9] Then there is this in addition that there is no discipline for keeping guard over the life of the clergy, but that he exhibits himself only as their lord.

[7:10] The last thing, but first in importance as evidence of elation, is about his use of the pallium outside the church, which is a thing he never presumed to do in the times of my predecessors, and what none of his predecessors ever presumed to do, as our delegates testify (except it might be when relics were deposited, though with regard to relics one person only could be found to say that it was so); yet this in my days, in contempt of me, with extreme audacity, he not only did, but even made a habit of doing.

[7:11] From all these things I find that the dignity of the Episcopacy is with him all in outside show, not in his mind.

[7:12] And indeed I return thanks to Almighty God that at the time when this came to my knowledge, which had never reached the ears of my predecessors, the Lombards were posted between me and the city of Ravenna.

[7:13] For perchance I had it in my mind to shew to men how severe I can be.

[7:14] Lest, however, thou shouldest suppose that I wish thy church to be depressed or lessened in dignity, remember where the deacon of Ravenna used to stand in solemnization of mass at Rome, and enquire where he stands now; and thou wilt recognize the fact that I desire to honour the church of Ravenna.

[7:15] But that any one whatever should snatch at anything out of pride, this I cannot tolerate.

[7:16] Nevertheless I have already written on this matter to our deacon at Constantinople, that he should enquire of all who have under them even thirty or forty bishops.

[7:17] And if there is anywhere this custom of their walking in litanies wearing the pallium, God forbid that through me the dignity of the church of Ravenna should seem to be in any way lessened.

[7:18] Reflect, therefore, dearest brother, on all that I have said above: think of the day of thy call: consider what account thou wilt render of the burden of episcopacy.

[7:19] Amend those manners of a notary.

[7:20] See what becomes a bishop in tongue and in deed.

[7:21] Be entirely sincere to thy brethren.

[7:22] Do not speak one thing, and have another in thy heart.

[7:23] Do not desire to seem more than thou art, that so thou mayest be able to be more than thou seemest.

[7:24] Believe me, when I came to my present position, I had such consideration and charity towards thee that, if thou hadst wished to keep hold of this my charity, thou still wouldest not have ever found such a brother as myself, or one so sincerely loving thee, or so concurring with thee in all devotion: but when I came to know of thy words and thy manners, I confess I started back.

[7:25] I beseech thee, then, by Almighty God, amend all that I have spoken of, and especially the vice of duplicity.

[7:26] Allow me to love thee; and for the present and the future life it may be of advantage to thee to be loved of thy brethren.

[7:27] Reply, however, to all this, not by words, but by behaviour.

[8:1] Epistle XVII.

[8:2] To Cyprian, Deacon.

[8:3] Gregory to Cyprian, &c.

[8:4] I received your letters of most bitter import about the death of the Lord Maximianus in the month of November.

[8:5] And he indeed has reached the rewards he longed for, but the unhappy people of the city of Syracuse is to be commiserated as not having been counted worthy to have such a pastor long.

[8:6] Accordingly let thy Love take anxious heed that such a one may be chosen for ordination in the same church as may not seem to obtain undeservedly the same place of rule after the lord Maximianus.

[8:7] And indeed I believe that the majority would choose the presbyter Trajan, who, as is said, is of a good disposition, but, as I suspect, not fit for ruling in that place.

[8:8] Yet, if a better cannot be found, and if there are no charges against him, he may be condescended to under stress of very great necessity.

[8:9] But, if my wishes are asked with regard to this election, I inform thee privately of what I do wish: for no one in this same church appears to me so worthy after the lord Maximianus as John the archdeacon of the church of Catana.

[8:10] And, if his election can be brought about, I believe that he will be found an exceedingly fit person.

[8:11] But he too must first be enquired about by thee privately as to any charges against him that may stand in the way.

[8:12] If he should be found free from any, he may be rightly chosen.

[8:13] Should this be done, our brother and fellow-bishop Leo will also have to give him leave to go, that he may be found  free to be ordained.

[8:14] These things, then, I have taken care to intimate to thy Love; and it will now be thy concern to look round thee on all sides carefully, and arrange what is pleasing to God.

[9:1] Epistle XVIII.

[9:2] To John, Bishop.

[9:3] Gregory to John, Bishop of Constantinople.

[9:4] At the time when your Fraternity was advanced to Sacerdotal dignity, you remember what peace and concord of the churches you found.

[9:5] But, with what daring or with what swelling of pride I know not, you have attempted to seize upon a new name, whereby the hearts of all your brethren might have come to take offence.

[9:6] I wonder exceedingly at this, since I remember how thou wouldest fain have fled from the episcopal office rather than attain it.

[9:7] And yet, now that thou hast got it, thou desirest so to exercise it as if thou hadst run to it with ambitious intent.

[9:8] For, having confessed thyself unworthy to be called a bishop, thou hast at length been brought to such a pass as, despising thy brethren, to covet to be named the only bishop.

[9:9] And indeed with regard to this matter, weighty letters were addressed to your Holiness by my predecessor Pelagius of holy memory; in which he annulled the acts of the synod, which had been assembled among you in the case of our once brother and fellow-bishop Gregory, because of that execrable title of pride, and forbade the archdeacon whom he had sent according to custom to the threshold of our lord, to celebrate the solemnities of mass with you.

[9:10] But after his death, when I, unworthy, succeeded to the government of the Church, both through my other representatives and also through our common son the deacon Sabinianus, I have taken care to address your Fraternity, not indeed in writing, but by word of mouth, desiring you to restrain yourself from such presumption.

[9:11] And, in case of your refusing to amend, I forbade his celebrating the solemnities of mass with you; that so I might first appeal to your Holiness through a certain sense of shame, to the end that, if the execrable and profane assumption could not be corrected through shame, strict canonical measures might be then resorted to.

[9:12] And, since sores that are to be cut away should first be stroked with a gentle hand, I beg you, I beseech you, and with all the sweetness in my power demand of you, that your Fraternity gainsay all who flatter you and offer you this name of error, nor foolishly consent to be called by the proud title.

[9:13] For truly I say it weeping, and out of inmost sorrow of heart attribute it to my sins, that this my brother, who has been constituted in the grade of episcopacy for the very end of bringing back the souls of others to humility, has up to the present time been incapable of being brought back to humility; that he who teaches truth to others has not consented to teach himself, even when I implore him.

[9:14] Consider, I pray thee, that in this rash presumption the peace of the whole Church is disturbed, and that it is in contradiction to the grace that is poured out on all in common; in which grace doubtless thou thyself wilt have power to grow so far as thou determinest with thyself to do so.

[9:15] And thou wilt become by so much the greater as thou restrainest thyself from the usurpation of a proud and foolish title: and thou wilt make advance in proportion as thou art not bent on arrogation by derogation of thy brethren.

[9:16] Wherefore, dearest brother, with all thy heart love humility, through which the concord of all the brethren and the unity of the holy universal Church may be preserved.

[9:17] Certainly the apostle Paul, when he heard some say, I am of Paul, I of Apollos, but I of Christ (1 Cor.

[9:18] i.

[9:19] 13), regarded with the utmost horror such dilaceration of the Lord's body, whereby they were joining themselves, as it were, to other heads, and exclaimed, saying, Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul (ib.

[9:20] )? If then he shunned the subjecting of the members of Christ partially to certain heads, as if beside Christ, though this were to the apostles themselves, what wilt thou say to Christ, who is the Head of the universal Church, in the scrutiny of the last judgment, having attempted to put all his members under thyself by the appellation of Universal? Who, I ask, is proposed for imitation in this wrongful title but he who, despising the legions of angels constituted socially with himself, attempted to start up to an eminence of singularity, that he might seem to be under none and to be alone above all? Who even said, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven: I will sit upon the mount of the testament, in the sides of the North: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High (Isai.

[9:21] xiv.

[9:22] 13).

[9:23] For what are all thy brethren, the bishops of the universal Church, but stars of heaven, whose life and discourse shine together amid the sins and errors of men, as if amid the shades of night? And when thou desirest to put thyself above them by this proud title, and to tread down their name in comparison with thine, what else dost thou say but I will  ascend into heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven? Are not all the bishops together clouds, who both rain in the words of preaching, and glitter in the light of good works? And when your Fraternity despises them, and you would fain press them down under yourself, what else say you but what is said by the ancient foe, I will ascend above the heights of the clouds? All these things when I behold with tears, and tremble at the hidden judgments of God, my fears are increased, and my heart cannot contain its groans, for that this most holy man the lord John, of so great abstinence and humility, has, through the seduction of familiar tongues, broken out into such a pitch of pride as to attempt, in his coveting of that wrongful name, to be like him who, while proudly wishing to be like God, lost even the grace of the likeness granted him, and because he sought false glory, thereby forfeited true blessedness.

[9:24] Certainly Peter, the first of the apostles, himself a member of the holy and universal Church, Paul, Andrew, John,—what were they but heads of particular communities? And yet all were members under one Head.

[9:25] And (to bind all together in a short girth of speech) the saints before the law, the saints under the law, the saints under grace, all these making up the Lord's Body, were constituted as members of the Church, and not one of them has wished himself to be called universal.

[9:26] Now let your Holiness acknowledge to what extent you swell within yourself in desiring to be called by that name by which no one presumed to be called who was truly holy.

[9:27] Was it not the case, as your Fraternity knows, that the prelates of this Apostolic See which by the providence of God I serve, had the honour offered them of being called universal by the venerable Council of Chalcedon.

[9:28] But yet not one of them has ever wished to be called by such a title, or seized upon this ill-advised name, lest if, in virtue of the rank of the pontificate, he took to himself the glory of singularity, he might seem to have denied it to all his brethren.

[9:29] But I know that all arises from those who serve your Holiness on terms of deceitful familiarity; against whom I beseech your Fraternity to be prudently on your guard, and not to lay yourself open to be deceived by their words.

[9:30] For they are to be accounted the greater enemies the more they flatter you with praises.

[9:31] Forsake such; and, if they must needs deceive, let them at any rate deceive the hearts of worldly men, and not of priests.

[9:32] Let the dead bury their dead (Luke ix.

[9:33] 60).

[9:34] But say ye with the prophet, Let them be turned back and put to shame that say unto me, Aha, Aha (Ps.

[9:35] lxix.

[9:36] 4).

[9:37] And again, But let not the oil of the sinner lard my head (Ps.

[9:38] cxl.

[9:39] 5).

[9:40] Whence also the wise man admonishes well, Be in peace with many: but have but one counsellor of a thousand (Ecclus.

[9:41] vi.

[9:42] 6).

[9:43] For Evil communications corrupt good manners (1 Cor.

[9:44] xv.

[9:45] 33).

[9:46] For the ancient foe, when unable to break into strong hearts, looks out for weak persons who are associated with them, and, as it were, scales lofty walls by ladders set against them.

[9:47] So he deceived Adam through the woman who was associated with him.

[9:48] So, when he slew the sons of the blessed Job, he left the weak woman, that, being unable of himself to penetrate his heart, he might at any rate be able to do so through the woman's words.

[9:49] Whatever weak and secular persons, then, are near you, let them be shattered in their own persuasive words and flattery, since they procure to themselves the eternal enmity of God from their very frowardness in being seeming lovers.

[9:50] Of a truth it was proclaimed of old through the Apostle John, Little children, it is the last hour (1 John ii.

[9:51] 18), according as the Truth foretold.

[9:52] And now pestilence and sword rage through the world, nations rise against nations, the globe of the earth is shaken, the gaping earth with its inhabitants is dissolved.

[9:53] For all that was foretold is come to pass.

[9:54] The king of pride is near, and (awful to be said!) there is an army of priests in course of preparation for him, inasmuch as they who had been appointed to be leaders in humility enlist themselves under the neck of pride.

[9:55] But in this matter, even though our tongue protested not at all, the power of Him who in His own person peculiarly opposes the vice of pride is lifted up for vengeance against elation.

[9:56] For hence it is written, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (Jam.

[9:57] iv.

[9:58] 6).

[9:59] Hence, again, it is said, Whoso exalteth his heart is unclean before God (Prov.

[9:60] xvi.

[9:61] 5).

[9:62] Hence, against the man that is proud it is written, Why is earth and ashes proud (Ecclus.

[9:63] x.

[9:64] 9)? Hence the Truth in person says, Whosoever  exalteth himself shall be abased (Luke xiv.

[9:65] 11).

[9:66] And, that he might bring us back to the way of life through humility, He deigned to exhibit in Himself what He teaches us, saying, Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart (Matth.

[9:67] xi.

[9:68] 29).

[9:69] For to this end the only begotten Son of God took upon Himself the form of our weakness; to this end the Invisible appeared not only as visible but even as despised; to this end He endured the mocks of contumely, the reproaches of derision, the torments of suffering; that God in His humility might teach man not to be proud.

[9:70] How great, then, is the virtue of humility for the sake of teaching which alone He who is great beyond compare became little even unto the suffering of death! For, since the pride of the devil was the origin of our perdition, the humility of God has been found the means of our redemption.

[9:71] That is to say, our enemy, having been created among all things, desired to appear exalted above all things; but our Redeemer remaining great above all things, deigned to become little among all things.

[9:72] What, then, can we bishops say for ourselves, who have received a place of honour from the humility of our Redeemer, and yet imitate the pride of the enemy himself? Lo, we know our Creator to have descended from the summit of His loftiness that He might give glory to the human race, and we, created of the lowest, glory in the lessening of our brethren.

[9:73] God humbled Himself even to our dust; and human dust sets his face as high as heaven, and with his tongue passes above the earth, and blushes not, neither is afraid to be lifted up: even man who is rottenness, and the son of man that is a worm.

[9:74] Let us recall to mind, most dear brother, this which is said by the most wise Solomon.

[9:75] Before thunder shall go lightning, and before ruin shall the heart be exalted (Ecclus.

[9:76] xxxii.

[9:77] 10); where, on the other hand it is subjoined, Before glory it shall be humbled.

[9:78] Let us then be humbled in mind, if we are striving to attain to real loftiness.

[9:79] By no means let the eyes of our heart be darkened by the smoke of elation, which the more it rises the more rapidly vanishes away.

[9:80] Let us consider how we are admonished by the precepts of our Redeemer, who says, Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (Matth.

[9:81] v.

[9:82] 3).

[9:83] Hence, also, he says by the prophet, On whom shall my Spirit rest, but on him that is humble, and quiet, and that trembleth at my words (Isai.

[9:84] lxvi.

[9:85] 2)? Of a truth, when the Lord would bring back the hearts of His disciples, still beset with infirmity, to the way of humility, He said, Whosoever will be chief among you shall be least of all (Matth.

[9:86] xx.

[9:87] 27).

[9:88] Whereby it is plainly seen how he is truly exalted on high who in his thoughts is humbled.

[9:89] Let us, therefore, fear to be numbered among those who seek the first seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the market, and to be called of men Rabbi.

[9:90] For, contrariwise, the Lord says to His disciples, But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master; and all ye are brethren.

[9:91] And call no man your Father upon the earth, for one is your Father (Matth.

[9:92] xxiii.

[9:93] 7, 8).

[9:94] What then, dearest brother, wilt thou say in that terrible scrutiny of the coming judgment, if thou covetest to be called in the world not only father, but even general father? Let, then, the bad suggestion of evil men be guarded against; let all instigation to offence be fled from.

[9:95] It must needs be (indeed) that offences come; nevertheless, woe to that man by whom the offence cometh (Matth.

[9:96] xviii.

[9:97] 7).

[9:98] Lo, by reason of this execrable title of pride the Church is rent asunder, the hearts of all the brethren are provoked to offence.

[9:99] What! Has it escaped your memory how the Truth says, Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill stone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea (Ib.

[9:100] v.

[9:101] 6)? But it is written, Charity seeketh not her own (1 Cor.

[9:102] xiii.

[9:103] 4).

[9:104] Lo, your Fraternity arrogates to itself even what is not its own.

[9:105] Again it is written, In honour preferring one another (Rom.

[9:106] xii.

[9:107] 10).

[9:108] And thou attemptest to take the honour away from all which thou desirest unlawfully to usurp to thyself singularly.

[9:109] Where, dearest brother, is that which is written, Have peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord (Heb.

[9:110] xii.

[9:111] 14)? Where is that which is written, Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God (Matth.

[9:112] v.

[9:113] 9)?  It becomes you to consider, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.

[9:114] But still, though we neglect to consider, supernal judgment will be on the watch against the swelling of so great elation.

[9:115] And we indeed, against whom such and so great a fault is committed by this nefarious attempt,—we, I say, are observing what the Truth enjoins when it says, If thy brother shall sin against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.

[9:116] If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

[9:117] But if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of one or two witnesses every word may be established.

[9:118] But if he will not hear them, tell it unto the Church.

[9:119] But if he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as an heathen  man and a publican (Matth.

[9:120] xviii.

[9:121] 15).

[9:122] I therefore have once and again through my representatives taken care to reprove in humble words this sin against the whole Church; and now I write myself.

[9:123] Whatever it was my duty to do in the way of humility I have not omitted.

[9:124] But, if I am despised in my reproof, it remains that I must have recourse to the Church.

[9:125] Wherefore may Almighty God show your Fraternity how great love for you constrains me when I thus speak, and how much I grieve in this case, not against you, but for you.

[9:126] But the case is such that in it I must prefer the precepts of the Gospel, the ordinances of the Canons, and the welfare of the brethren to the person even of him whom I greatly love.

[9:127] I have received the most sweet and pleasant letter of your Holiness with respect to the case of the presbyters John and Athanasius, about which, the Lord helping me, I will reply to you in another letter; for, being surrounded by the swords of barbarians, I am now oppressed by such great tribulations that it is not allowed me, I will not say to treat of many things, but hardly even to breathe.

[9:128] Given in the Kalends of January; Indiction 13.

[10:1] Epistle XIX.

[10:2] To Sabinianus, Deacon.

[10:3] Gregory to Sabinianus, &c.

[10:4] In the cause of our brother the most reverend John, bishop of Constantinople, I have been unwilling to write two letters.

[10:5] But one I have drawn up briefly, which may seem to combine both requisites; that is to say, both honesty and kindness.

[10:6] Let therefore thy Love take care to give him this letter which I have now addressed to him in compliance with the wish of the Emperor.

[10:7] For in the sequel another will be sent him such as his pride will not rejoice in.

[10:8] For he has come even to this; that, taking occasion of the case of John the presbyter, he transmitted hither the acts, wherein almost in every line he called himself οἰκουμενικὸν (oecumenical) patriarch.

[10:9] But I hope in Almighty God that the Supernal Majesty will confound his hypocrisy.

[10:10] But I wonder how he could so deceive thy Love as that thou shouldest allow the lord Emperor to be persuaded to write to me himself concerning this matter, admonishing me to have peace with him.

[10:11] For, if the lord Emperor wishes to observe justice, he ought to have admonished him to refrain from the proud title, and then at once there would be peace between us.

[10:12] I suspect, however, that thou hast not all considered with what cunningness this has been done by our aforesaid brother John.

[10:13] For it is for this purpose that he has done it; that the lord Emperor might be obeyed, and so he himself might seem to be confirmed in his vanity, or that I might not obey him, and so his mind might be irritated against me.

[10:14] But we will keep to the right way, fearing nothing in this cause except the Almighty Lord.

[10:15] Wherefore let thy Love be in nothing afraid.

[10:16] All things that you see to be lofty in this world against the truth in behalf of the truth despise; trust in the grace of Almighty God, and the help of the blessed Apostle Peter.

[10:17] Remember the voice of the Truth, which says, Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world (1 John iv.

[10:18] 4); and in this cause whatever has to be done, do it with the utmost authority.

[10:19] For now that we can in no wise be protected from the swords of our enemies, now that for love of the republic we have lost silver, gold, slaves and clothing, it is too ignominious that through those men we should lose even the faith.

[10:20] For to assent to that atrocious title is nothing else than to lose the faith.

[10:21] Wherefore, as I have written to thee already in former letters, never do thou presume to proceed with him.

[11:1] Epistle XX.

[11:2] To Mauricius Augustus.

[11:3] Gregory to Mauricius, &c.

[11:4] Our most pious and God-appointed lord, among his other august cares and burdens, watches also in the uprightness of spiritual zeal over the preservation of peace among the priesthood, inasmuch as he piously and truly considers that no one can govern earthly things aright unless he knows how to deal with divine things, and that the peace of the republic hangs on the peace of the universal Church.

[11:5] For, most serene Lord, what human power, and what strength of fleshly arm would presume to lift irreligious hands against the lofty height of your most Christian Empire, if the concordant hearts of priests were studious to implore their Redeemer for you with the tongue, and also, as they ought to do, by their deservings? Or what sword of a most savage race would advance with so great cruelty to the slaughter of the faithful, unless the life  of us, who are called priests but are not, were weighed down by works most wicked.

[11:6] But while we neglect the things that concern us, and think of those that concern us not, we associate our sins with the barbaric forces and our fault, which weighs down the forces of the republic, sharpens the swords of the enemy.

[11:7] But what shall we say for ourselves, who press down the people of God which we are unworthily set over with the loads of our sins; who destroy by example what we preach with the tongue; who by our works teach unrighteous things, and with our voice only set forth the things that are righteous? Our bones are worn down by fasts, and in our mind we swell.

[11:8] Our body is covered with vile raiment, and in elation of heart we surpass the purple.

[11:9] We lie in ashes, and look down upon loftiness.

[11:10] Teachers of humility, we are chiefs of pride; behind the faces of sheep we hide the teeth of wolves.

[11:11] But what is the end of these things except that we persuade men, but are manifest to God? Wherefore most providently for restraining warlike movements does the most pious lord seek the peace of the Church, and, for compacting it, deigns to bring back the hearts of its priests to concord.

[11:12] And this indeed is what I wish; and, as far as I am concerned, I render obedience to his most serene commands.

[11:13] But since it is not my cause, but God's, since the pious laws, since the venerable synods, since the very commands of our Lord Jesus Christ are disturbed by the invention of a certain proud and pompous phrase, let the most pious lord cut the place of the sore, and bind the resisting patient in the chains of august authority.

[11:14] For in binding up these things tightly you relieve the republic; and while you cut off such things, you provide for the lengthening of your reign.

[11:15] For to all who know the Gospel it is apparent that by the Lord's voice the care of the whole Church was committed to the holy Apostle and Prince of all the Apostles, Peter.

[11:16] For to him it is said, Peter, lovest thou Me? Feed My sheep (John xxi.

[11:17] 17).

[11:18] To him it is said, Behold Satan hath desired to sift you as wheat; and I have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not.

[11:19] And thou, when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren (Luke xxii.

[11:20] 31).

[11:21] To him it is said, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

[11:22] And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind an earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven (Matth.

[11:23] xvi.

[11:24] 18).

[11:25] Lo, he received the keys of the heavenly kingdom, and power to bind and loose is given him, the care and principality of the whole Church is committed to him, and yet he is not called the universal apostle; while the most holy man, my fellow-priest John, attempts to be called universal bishop.

[11:26] I am compelled to cry out and say, O tempora, O mores!  Lo, all things in the regions of Europe are given up into the power of barbarians, cities are destroyed, camps overthrown, provinces depopulated, no cultivator inhabits the land, worshippers of idols rage and dominate daily for the slaughter of the faithful, and yet priests, who ought to lie weeping on the ground and in ashes, seek for themselves names of vanity, and glory in new and profane titles.

[11:27] Do I in this matter, most pious lord, defend my own cause? Do I resent my own special wrong? Nay, the cause of Almighty God, the cause of the Universal Church.

[11:28] Who is this that, against the evangelical ordinances, against the decrees of canons, presumes to usurp to himself a new name? Would indeed that one by himself he were, if he could be without any lessening of others,—he that covets to be universal.

[11:29] And certainly we know that many priests of the Constantinopolitan Church have fallen into the whirlpool of heresy, and have become not only heretics, but even heresiarchs.

[11:30] For thence came Nestorius, who, thinking Jesus Christ, the Mediator of God and men, to be two persons, because he did not believe that God could be made man, broke out even into Jewish perfidy.

[11:31] Thence came Macedonius, who denied that God the Holy Spirit was consubstantial with the Father and the Son.

[11:32] If then any one in that Church takes to himself that name, whereby he makes himself the head of all the good, it follows that the Universal Church falls from its standing (which God forbid), when he who is called Universal falls.

[11:33] But far from Christian hearts be that name of blasphemy, in which the honour of all priests is taken away, while it is madly arrogated to himself by one.

[11:34] Certainly, in honour of Peter, Prince of the apostles, it was offered by the venerable synod of Chalcedon to the Roman pontiff.

[11:35] But none of them has ever consented to use this name of singularity, lest, by something being given peculiarly to one, priests in general should be deprived of the honour due to them.

[11:36] How is it then that we do not seek the glory of this title even when offered, and another  presumes to seize it for himself though not offered?  He, then, is rather to be bent by the mandate of our most pious Lords, who scorns to render obedience to canonical injunctions.

[11:37] He is to be coerced, who does wrong to the holy Universal Church, who swells in heart, who covets rejoicing in a name of singularity, who also puts himself above the dignity of your Empire through a title peculiar to himself.

[11:38] Behold, we all suffer offence for this thing.

[11:39] Let then the author of the offence be brought back to a right way of life; and all quarrels of priests will cease.

[11:40] For I for my part am the servant of all priests, so long as they live as becomes priests.

[11:41] For whosoever, through the swelling of vain glory, lifts up his neck against Almighty God and against the statutes of the Fathers, I trust in Almighty God that he will not bend my neck to himself, not even with swords.

[11:42] Moreover what has been done in this city on our hearing of this title, I have indicated in full to my deacon and responsalis Sabinianus.

[11:43] Let then the piety of my lords think of me as their own, whom they have always cherished and countenanced beyond others, and who desire to render obedience to you and yet fear to be found guilty in the heavenly and tremendous judgment, and, according to the petition of the aforesaid deacon Sabinianus, let my most pious lord either deign to judge this business, or to move the often before mentioned man to desist at length from this attempt.

[11:44] If then through the most just judgment of your Piety he should comply with your orders, even though they be mild ones, we shall return thanks to Almighty God, and rejoice for the peace granted through you to all the Church.

[11:45] But should he persist any longer in his present contention, we hold this sentence of the Truth to be already made good; Every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled (Luke xiv.

[11:46] 11; xviii.

[11:47] 14).

[11:48] And again it is written, Before a fall the heart is lifted up (Prov.

[11:49] xvi.

[11:50] 18).

[11:51] I however, rendering obedience to the commands of my lords, have both written sweetly to my aforesaid fellow-priest, and humbly admonished him to amend himself of this coveting of empty glory.

[11:52] If therefore he be willing to hear me, he has a devoted brother.

[11:53] But, if he persists in pride, I already see what will follow:—that he will find Him as his adversary of whom it is written, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (Jam.

[11:54] iv.

[11:55] 6).

[12:1] Epistle XXI.

[12:2] To Constantina Augusta.

[12:3] Gregory to Constantina, &c.

[12:4] Almighty God, who holds in His right hand the heart of your Piety, both protects us through you and prepares for you rewards of eternal remuneration for temporal deeds.

[12:5] For I have learnt from the letters of the deacon Sabinianus my responsalis with what justice your Serenity is interested in the cause of the blessed Prince of the apostles Peter against certain persons who are proudly humble and feignedly kind.

[12:6] And I trust in the bounty of our Redeemer that for these your good offices with the most serene lord and his most pious sons you will receive retribution also in the heavenly country.

[12:7] Nor is there any doubt that you will receive eternal benefits, being loosed from the chains of your sins, if in the cause of his Church you have made him your debtor to whom the power of binding and of loosing has been given.

[12:8] Wherefore I still beg you to allow no man's hypocrisy to prevail against the truth, since there are some who, according to the saying of the excellent preacher, by sweet words and fair speeches seduce the hearts of the innocent,—men who are vile in raiment, but puffed up in heart.

[12:9] And they affect to despise all things in this world, and yet seek to acquire for themselves all the things that are of this world.

[12:10] They confess themselves unworthy before all men, but cannot be content with private titles, since they covet that whereby they may seem to be more worthy than all.

[12:11] Let therefore your Piety, whom Almighty God has appointed with our most serene Lord to be over the whole world, through your favouring of justice render service to Him from whom you have received your right to so great a dominion, that you may rule over the world that is committed to you so much the more securely as you more truly serve the Author of all things in the execution of truth.

[12:12] Furthermore, I inform you that I have received a letter from the most pious lord desiring me to be pacific towards my brother and fellow-priest John.

[12:13] And indeed so it became the religious lord to give injunctions to priests.

[12:14] But, when this my brother with new presumption and pride calls himself universal bishop, having caused himself in the time of our predecessor of holy memory to be designated in synod by this so proud a title, though all the acts of that synod were abrogated,  being disallowed by the Apostolic See,—the most serene lord gives me a somewhat distressing intimation, in that he has not rebuked him who is acting proudly, but endeavours to bend me from my purpose, who in this cause of defending the truth of the Gospels and Canons, of humility and rectitude; whereas my aforesaid brother and fellow-priest is acting against evangelical principles and also against the blessed Apostle Peter, and against all the churches, and against the ordinances of the Canons.

[12:15] But the Lord, in whose hands are all things, is almighty; of Him it is written, There is no wisdom nor prudence nor counsel against the Lord (Prov.

[12:16] xxi.

[12:17] 30).

[12:18] And indeed my often before mentioned most holy brother endeavours to persuade my most serene lord of many things: but well I know that all those prayers of his and all those tears will not allow my lord to be in any thing cajoled by any one against reason or his own soul.

[12:19] Still it is very distressing, and hard to be borne with patience, that my aforesaid brother and fellow-bishop, despising all others, should attempt to be called sole bishop.

[12:20] But in this pride of his what else is denoted than that the times of Antichrist are already near at hand? For in truth he is imitating him who, scorning social joy with the legions of angels, attempted to start up to a summit of singular eminence, saying, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven, I will sit upon the mount of the testament, in the sides of the North, and will ascend above the heights of the clouds, and I will be like the most High (Isai.

[12:21] xiv.

[12:22] 13).

[12:23] Wherefore I beseech you by Almighty God not to allow the times of your Piety to be polluted by the elation of one man, nor in any way to give any assent to so perverse a title, and that in this case your Piety may by no means despise me; since, though the sins of Gregory are so great that he ought to suffer such things, yet there are no sins of the Apostle Peter that he should deserve in your times to suffer thus.

[12:24] Wherefore again and again I beseech you by Almighty God that, as the princes your ancestors have sought the favour of the holy Apostle Peter, so you also take heed both to seek it for yourselves and to keep it, and that his honour among you be in no degree lessened on account of our sins who unworthily serve him, seeing that he is able both to be your helper now in all things and hereafter to remit your sins.

[12:25] Moreover, it is now even seven years that we have been living in this city among the swords of the Lombards.

[12:26] How much is expended on them daily by this Church, that we may be able to live among them, is not to be told.

[12:27] But I briefly indicate that, as in the regions of Ravenna the Piety of my Lords has for the first army of Italy a treasurer (sacellarium) to defray the daily expenses for recurring needs, so I also in this city am their treasurer for such purposes.

[12:28] And yet this Church, which at one and the same time unceasingly expends so much on clergy, monasteries, the poor, the people, and in addition on the Lombards, lo it is still pressed down by the affliction of all the Churches, which groan much for this pride of one man, though they do not presume to say anything.

[12:29] Further, a bishop of the city of Salona has been ordained without the knowledge of me and my responsalis, and a thing has been done which never happened under any former princes.

[12:30] When I heard of this, I at once sent word to that prevaricator, who had been irregularly ordained, that he must not presume by any means to celebrate the solemnities of mass, unless we should have first ascertained from our most serene lords that they had ordered this to be done; and this I commanded him under pain of excommunication.

[12:31] And yet, scorning and despising me, supported by the audacity of certain secular persons, to whom he is said to give many bribes so as to impoverish his Church, he presumes up to this time to celebrate mass, and has refused to come to me according to the order of my lords.

[12:32] Now I, obeying the injunction of their Piety, have from my heart forgiven this same Maximus, who had been ordained without my knowledge, his presumption in passing over me and my responsalis in his ordination, even as though he had been ordained with my authority.

[12:33] But his other wrong doings—to wit his bodily transgressions, which I have heard of, and his having been elected through bribery, and his having presumed to celebrate mass while excommunicated—these things, for the sake of God, I cannot pass over without enquiry.

[12:34] But I hope, and implore the Lord, that no fault may be found in him with respect to these things that are reported, and that his case may be terminated without peril to my soul.

[12:35] Nevertheless, before this has been ascertained, my most serene lord, in the order that has been despatched, has enjoined me to receive him with honour when he comes.

[12:36] And it is a very serious thing that a man of whom so many things of such a nature are reported should be honoured before such things have been enquired into and sifted, as they ought in the first place to be.

[12:37] And, if the causes of the bishops who are committed to me are settled before my most pious lords under the patronage of others, what shall I do, unhappy that I am, in this Church? But that my bishops despise me, and have recourse to secular Judges against me, I give thanks to  Almighty God that I attribute it to my sins.

[12:38] This however I briefly intimate, because I am waiting for a little while; and, if he should long delay coming to me, I shall in no wise hesitate to exercise strict canonical discipline in his case.

[12:39] But I trust in Almighty God, that He will give long life to our most pious Lords, and order things for us under your hand, not according to our sins, but according to the gifts of His grace.

[12:40] These things, then, I suggest to my most tranquil lady, since I am not ignorant with how great zeal for rectitude the most pure conscience of her Serenity is moved.

[13:1] Epistle XXIII.

[13:2] To Castorius, Notary.

[13:3] Gregory to Castorius, &c.

[13:4] Our hearing of the death of our brother and fellow-bishop John has greatly saddened us especially as that city at this time has lost the solace of pastoral care.

[13:5] Wherefore, since very many advantages to the Church itself demand that, under the guidance of Christ, a priest should be ordained without delay, we accordingly charge thy Experience to exhort the clergy and people with all urgency that they delay not to elect for themselves a priest to be consecrated.

[13:6] This however, and before all things, we desire thee to press upon them, that in the general cause they regard not their own private interests.

[13:7] Let there be no venality, then, in this election, lest, while they covet rewards, they lose their discrimination of choice and think that man worthy for this office who may have pleased them, not by his merits, but by his gifts.

[13:8] For let them especially and absolutely know this, that he is not only unworthy of the priesthood, but will also certainly become further culpable, whosoever may presume to make merchandise of the gift of God by thinking to purchase it for a price.

[13:9] Wherefore let not him that is liberal in bribes, but him that is worthy for his merits, be chosen.

[13:10] For the penalty will affect both the elected and the electors, if they attempt with sacrilegious mind to violate the purity of the priesthood.

[13:11] Moreover, whether one or two may have been elected, by all means warn five of the senior presbyters and five of the leading people to come to us together.

[13:12] But with respect to the clergy, if, besides those who determine to come, you are of opinion that the presence of any others is necessary, send them to us without delay, that there may be no plea of excuse, nor any delay ensue, in setting the Church in order.

[14:1] Epistle XXV.

[14:2] To Severus, Bishop.

[14:3] Gregory to Severus, Bishop of Ficulum.

[14:4] The report that has been sent to us has informed us of the death of the bishop John.

[14:5] Wherefore we solemnly delegate to thy Fraternity the work of the visitation of the bereaved Church: which work it becomes thee so to execute that no one may presume to interfere with respect to the promotions of the clergy, the revenues, ornaments, ministrations, or whatever else belongs to the patrimony of the same Church.

[14:6] According to custom.

[15:1] Epistle XXVI.

[15:2] To the people of Ravenna.

[15:3] Gregory to the clergy, gentry, and common people of Ravenna.

[15:4] Having been informed of the death of your bishop, we have taken care to delegate to our brother and fellow-bishop Severus of Ficulum the visitation of the bereaved Church, to whom we have given in charge to allow nothing with respect to the promotions of the clergy, the revenues, ornaments, and ministrations, to be usurped by any one.

[15:5] It is for you to render obedience to his assiduous exhortations.

[15:6] According to custom.

[16:1] Epistle XXIX.

[16:2] To Vincomalus, Guardian (Defensorem).

[16:3] Gregory to Vincomalus, &c.

[16:4] With a view to the advantage of the Church it is our will and pleasure, that, if thou art held bound by no condition of, or liability to, bodily service, and hast not been a cleric of any other city, and if there is no canonical objection to thee, thou take the office of guardian of the Church, that thou mayest execute incorruptly and with alacrity whatever may be enjoined thee by us for the benefit of the poor, using this privilege which after deliberation we have conferred upon thee, so as to do thy diligence faithfully in accomplishing all that may be enjoined on thee by us, as having to render an account of thy doings under the judgment of our God.

[16:5] This epistle we have dictated, to be committed to writing, to Paterius, notary of our Church; In the month of March, Indiction 13.

[17:1] Epistle XXX.

[17:2] To Mauricius Augustus.

[17:3] Gregory to Mauricius, &c.

[17:4] The Piety of my Lords, which has been wont mercifully to sustain your servants, has shone forth here in so kind a supply that the need of all the feeble has been relieved by the succour of your bounty.

[17:5] On this account we all with prayers and tears beseech Almighty God, who has moved the heart of your Clemency to do this thing, that He would preserve the empire of our Lords safe in His unfailing love, and by the aid of His own majesty extend their victories in all nations.

[17:6] The thirty pounds of gold which my fellow-servant Busa brought, Scribo has distributed faithfully to priests, persons in need, and others.

[17:7] And, since certain females devoted to a religious life (sanctimoniales foeminae) have come to this city from divers provinces, having fled hither after captivity, of whom some, so far as there was room for them, have been placed in monasteries, but others, who could not be taken in, lead a life of singular destitution, it has been thought good that what could be spared from the relief of the blind, maimed and feeble should be distributed to them, so that not only needy natives, but also strangers who arrive here, might receive of the compassion of our Lords.

[17:8] Hence it has been brought about that all alike with one accord pray for the life of our lords, that so Almighty God may give you a long and quiet life, and grant to the most happy offspring of your Piety to flourish long in the Roman republic.

[17:9] The pay also of the soldiers has been so distributed by my aforesaid fellow-servant Scribo, in the presence also of the glorious Castus, magister militum, that all received with thanks the gifts of our lords under due discipline, and abstained from all murmuring such as was formerly wont to prevail among them.

[18:1] Epistle XXXVI.

[18:2] To Severus, Scholasticus  Gregory to Severus, Scholasticus to the Exarch.

[18:3] Those who assist judges and are bound to them by sincere attachment ought to advise them and suggest to them what may both save their souls and not derogate from their reputation.

[18:4] This being so, since we know with what sincere loyalty you love the most excellent Exarch, we have been careful to inform your Greatness of the things that have been done, that, being aware of them, you may move him to assent to them reasonably.

[18:5] Know then that Agilulph, King of the Lombards, is not unwilling to conclude a general peace, if only the lord Patricius will consent to an arbitration.

[18:6] For he complains that many acts of violence were committed in his regions during the time of peace.

[18:7] And since, if reasonable grounds for arbitration should be found, he desires to have satisfaction made to himself, he also himself promises to make satisfaction in all ways, if it should appear that any wrong was committed on his side during the peace.

[18:8] Since then it is no doubt reasonable to agree to what he asks, there ought to be an arbitration, that, if any wrongs have been done on either side, they may be adjusted; so that it may be possible, with the protection of God, to establish a general peace; for how necessary for us all this is you well know.

[18:9] Act therefore wisely as you have been wont to do, that the most excellent Exarch may consent to this without delay, lest peace should appear to be refused by him, as should not be.

[18:10] For, should he be unwilling to consent, he indeed [Agilulph] again promises to conclude a special peace with us; but we know that divers islands and other places would undoubtedly in that case be ruined.

[18:11] However, let him [the Exarch] consider these things, and hasten to make peace, to the end that at any rate during this cessation of hostilities we may have some degree of quiet, and the forces of the republic may with the help of God be the better repaired for resistance.

[19:1] Epistle XXXIX.

[19:2] To Anastasius, Bishop.

[19:3] Gregory to Anastasius, Bishop of Antioch.

[19:4] Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will (Luke ii.

[19:5] 14), because that great river which once had left the rocks of Antioch dry has returned at length to its proper channel, and waters the subject valleys that are near, so as also to bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, some sixty-fold, and some an hundred-fold.

[19:6] For now there is no doubt that many flowers of souls are growing up in its valleys, and that they will come even to ripe fruit through the streams of your tongue.

[19:7] Wherefore with voice of heart and mouth from our inmost soul we render due  praise to Almighty God, and rejoice in your Blessedness, not with you only, but with all who are subject to you.

[19:8] I have received the letters of your Holiness, to me most sweet and pleasant, while we ourselves, if I may so speak, are sweating under the same toil with you.

[19:9] And indeed I know how heavy must be to thee the burden of external cares after those heights of rest, wherein with the hand of the heart thou wert touching heavenly secrets.

[19:10] But remember that thou rulest an Apostolic See, and assuagest sorrow the more readily from being made all things to all men.

[19:11] In the Books of Kings, as your accomplished Holiness knows, a certain man is described who used either hand for the right hand (1 Chron.

[19:12] xii.

[19:13] 2).

[19:14] And, with regard to this, I am not doubtful about the lord Anastasius, of old my most sweet and most holy patron, that, while he draws earthly works to heavenly profit, he turns the left hand to the right hand's use; so that his heavenly intentness may accomplish its work, so to speak, with the right hand, and also, when he is led in his care of temporal things towards the interests of justice, the left hand may acquire the strength of the right.

[19:15] And indeed these things cannot be without heavy labour and trouble.

[19:16] But let us remember the labours of those who went before us; and what we endure will not be hard.

[19:17] For We must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of God (Acts xiv.

[19:18] 22).

[19:19] And, We were pressed out of measure, yea and above strength, insomuch that we were weary even of life.

[19:20] But we ourselves, too, had the answer of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves (2 Cor.

[19:21] i.

[19:22] 8, 9).

[19:23] And yet The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the supervening glory which shall be revealed in us (Rom.

[19:24] viii.

[19:25] 18).

[19:26] How then can we that are weak sheep pass without labour through the heat of this world wherein we know that even rams have suffered under heavy toil?  Further, what tribulations I suffer in this land from the swords of the Lombards, from the iniquities of judges, from the press of business, from the care of subjects, and also from bodily affliction, I am unable to express either by pen or tongue.

[19:27] Concerning which things even though I might say something briefly, I hesitate, lest to your most holy Charity, while afflicted by your own tribulations, I should add mine also.

[19:28] But may Almighty God both in the abundance of His loving-kindness fill the mind of your most holy Blessedness with all comfort, and grant at some time, on account of your intercession, to unworthy me to rest from these evils which I sufferi, Amen.

[19:29] Grace.

[19:30] These words, as you see, taken from what you had written, I insert in my epistles, that your Blessedness may perceive with regard to Saint Ignatius that he is not only yours, but also ours.

[19:31] For, as we have his master, the Prince of the apostles in common, so also no one of us ought to have to himself alone the disciple of this same Prince.

[19:32] Moreover, we have received your blessing, which is of sweet smell and of a good savour, with the feelings that were due to it.

[19:33] And we give thanks to Almighty God that what you do, what you say, and what you give, is fragrant and savoury.

[19:34] For your life therefore let us say together, let us say all, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.

[20:1] Epistle XL.

[20:2] To Mauricius Augustus.

[20:3] Gregory to Mauricius, &c.

[20:4] The Piety of my Lords in their most serene commands, while set on refuting me on certain matters, in sparing me has by no means spared me.

[20:5] For by the use therein of the term simplicity they politely call me silly.

[20:6] It is true indeed that in Holy Scripture, when simplicity is spoken of in a good sense, it is often carefully associated with prudence and uprightness.

[20:7] Hence it is written of the blessed Job, The man was simple and upright (Job i.

[20:8] 1).

[20:9] And the blessed Apostle Paul admonishes saying Be ye simple in evil and prudent in good (Rom.

[20:10] xvi.

[20:11] 19).

[20:12] And the Truth in person admonishes saying, Be ye prudent as serpents, and simple as doves (Matth.

[20:13] x.

[20:14] 16); thus shewing it to be very unprofitable if either prudence should be wanting to simplicity, or simplicity to prudence.

[20:15] In order, then, to make His servants instructed for all things He desired them to be both simple as doves, and prudent as serpents, that so both the cunning of the serpent might sharpen in them the simplicity of the dove, and the simplicity of the dove temper the cunning of the serpent.

[20:16] I therefore, who am denounced in the most serene commands of my Lords as simple without the addition of prudence, as having been deceived by the cunning of Ariulph, am plainly and undoubtedly called silly; which I also myself acknowledge to be the case.

[20:17] For, though your Piety were silent, the facts  cry out.

[20:18] For, if I had not been silly, I should by no means have come to endure what I suffer in this place among the swords of the Lombards.

[20:19] Moreover, in what I stated about Ariulph, that he was prepared with all his heart to come to terms with the republic, seeing that I am not believed, I am reproved also as having lied.

[20:20] But, although I am not a priest, I know it to be a grave injury to a priest that, being a servant of the truth, he should be believed to be deceitful.

[20:21] And I have been for some time aware that Nordulph is believed before me, and Leo before me, and that now easy credence is given to those who seem to be in your confidence more than to my assertions.

[20:22] And indeed if the captivity of my land were not increasing day by day, I would gladly pass over in silence contempt and ridicule of myself.

[20:23] But this does afflict me exceedingly, that from my bearing the charge of falsehood it ensues also that Italy is daily led captive under the yoke of the Lombards.

[20:24] And, while my representations are in no wise believed, the strength of the enemy is increasing hugely.

[20:25] This however I suggest to my most pious lord, that he would think anything that is bad of me, but, with regard to the advantage of the republic and the cause of the rescue of Italy, not easily lend his pious ears to any one, but believe facts rather than words.

[20:26] Moreover, let not our lord, in virtue of his earthly power, too hastily disdain priests, but with excellent consideration, on account of Him whose servants they are, so rule over them as also to pay the reverence that is due to them.

[20:27] For in Holy Writ priests are sometimes called gods, and sometimes angels.

[20:28] For even through Moses it is said of him who is to be put upon his oath, Bring him unto the gods (Exod.

[20:29] xxii.

[20:30] 8); that is unto the priests.

[20:31] And again it is written, Thou shalt not revile the gods (Ib.

[20:32] 28), to wit, the priests.

[20:33] And the prophet says, The priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth; for he is the angel of the Lord of hosts (Malach.

[20:34] ii.

[20:35] 7).

[20:36] Why, then, should it be strange if your Piety were to condescend to honour those to whom even God Himself in His word gives honour, calling them angels or gods?  Ecclesiastical history also testifies that, when accusations in writing against bishops had been offered to the Prince Constantine of pious memory, he received indeed the bills of accusation, but, calling together the bishops who had been accused, he burnt before their eyes the bills which he had received, saying, Ye are gods, constituted by the true God.

[20:37] Go, and settle your causes among you, for it is not fit that we should judge gods.

[20:38] Yet in this sentence, my pious Lord, he conferred more on himself by his humility than on them by the reverence paid to them.

[20:39] For before him there were pagan princes in the republic, who knew not the true God, but worshipped gods of wood and stone; and yet they paid the greatest honour to their priests.

[20:40] What wonder then if a Christian emperor should condescend to honour the priests of the true God, when pagan princes, as we have already said, knew how to bestow honour on priests who served gods of wood and stone? These things, then, I suggest to the piety of my Lords, not in my own behalf, but in behalf of all priests.

[20:41] For I am a man that is a sinner.

[20:42] And, since I offend against Almighty God incessantly every day, I surmise that it will be some amends for this at the tremendous judgment, that I am smitten incessantly every day by blows.

[20:43] And I believe that you appease the same Almighty God all the more as you more severely afflict me who serve Him badly.

[20:44] For I had already received many blows, and when the commands of my Lords came in addition, I found consolations that I was not hoping for.

[20:45] For, if I can, I will briefly enumerate these blows.

[20:46] First, that the peace which without any cost to the republic I had made with the Lombards who were in Tuscany was withdrawn from me.

[20:47] Then, the peace having been broken, the soldiers were removed from the Roman city.

[20:48] And some indeed were slain by the enemy, but others were placed at Narnii and Perusium (Perugia); and Rome was left, that Perusium might be held.

[20:49] After this a still heavier blow was the arrival of Agilulph, so that I saw with my own eyes Romans tied by the neck with ropes like dogs, to be taken to France for sale.

[20:50] And, because we who were within the city under the protection of God escaped his hands, a ground was thence sought for making us appear culpable; to wit, because corn ran short, which cannot by any means be kept in large quantities for long in this city; as I have shewn more fully in another representation.

[20:51] On my own account indeed I was in no wise disturbed, since I declare, my conscience bearing me witness, that I was prepared to suffer any adversity whatever, so long as I came out of all these things with the safety of my soul.

[20:52] But for the glorious men, Gregory the praefect, and Castorius the military commander (magistro militum), I have been distressed in no small degree, seeing that they in no way neglected to do all that could be done, and endured most severe toil in watching  and guarding the city during the siege, and, after all this, were smitten by the heavy indignation of my Lords.

[20:53] As to them, I clearly understand that it is not their conduct, but my person, that goes against them.

[20:54] For, having with me alike laboured in trouble, they are alike troubled after labour.

[20:55] Now as to the Piety of my Lords holding out over me the formidable and terrible judgment of Almighty God, I beseech you by the same Almighty God to do this no more.

[20:56] For as yet we know not how any of us will stand there.

[20:57] And Paul, the excellent preacher, says, Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts (1 Cor.

[20:58] iv.

[20:59] 5).

[20:60] Yet this I briefly say, that, unworthy sinner as I am, I rely more on the mercy of Jesus when He comes than on the justice of your Piety.

[20:61] And there are many things that men are ignorant of with regard to this judgment; for perhaps He will blame what you praise, and praise what you blame.

[20:62] Wherefore among all these uncertainties I return to tears only, praying that the same Almighty God may both direct our most pious Lord with His hand and in that terrible judgment find him free from all defaults.

[20:63] And may He make me so to please men, if need be, as not to offend against His eternal grace.

[21:1] Epistle XLI.

[21:2] To Constantina Augusta.

[21:3] Gregory to Constantina, &c.

[21:4] Knowing how my most serene Lady thinks about the heavenly country and the life of her soul, I consider that I should be greatly in fault were I to keep silence on matters that ought to be represented to her for the fear of God.

[21:5] Having ascertained that there are many of the natives in the island of Sardinia who still, after the evil custom of their race, practise sacrifices to idols, and that the priests of the same island are sluggish in preaching our Redeemer, I sent thither one of the bishops of Italy, who with the co-operation of the Lord has brought many of the natives to the faith.

[21:6] But he has reported to me a sacrilegious proceeding, namely, that those in the island who sacrifice to idols pay a bribe to the judge for license to do this.

[21:7] And, when some of them had been baptized and had ceased sacrificing to idols, the same payment had been exacted by this same judge of the island, even after their baptism, which they had been previously accustomed to make for leave to sacrifice to idols.

[21:8] And, when the aforesaid bishop found fault with him, he replied that he had promised so large a suffragium that he could not make it up except by aid from cases of this kind.

[21:9] But the island of Corsica is oppressed by such an excessive number of exactors and such a burden of exactions, that those who are in it are hardly able to make up what is exacted except by selling their children.

[21:10] Hence it ensues that the proprietors of this island, deserting the pious republic, are forced to take refuge with that most wicked nation of the Lombards.

[21:11] For what can they suffer from barbarians harder or more cruel than being so straitened and squeezed as to be compelled to sell their children? Moreover, in the island of Sicily one Stephen, chartularius of the maritime parts, is said to practise such illegalities and such oppressions, invading places that belong to various persons, and without any legal process putting up titles on properties and houses, that, if I wished to tell every one of his doings that have come to my ears, I could not accomplish the task in a large volume.

[21:12] Let my most serene Lady look to all these things wisely, and assuage the groans of the oppressed.

[21:13] For I suspect that these things have not come to your most pious ears.

[21:14] For if they could have reached them, they would by no means have continued until now.

[21:15] But they should be represented now at a suitable time to our most pious lord, that he may remove such and so great a burden of sin from his own soul, from the empire, and from his sons.

[21:16] I know he will say that whatever is collected from the aforesaid islands is transmitted to us for the expenses of Italy.

[21:17] But in reply to this I suggest that, even though less expenditure were bestowed on Italy, he should still rid his empire of the tears of the oppressed.

[21:18] For perhaps, too, such great expenditure in this land profits less than it might do because the money for it is collected with some admixture of sin.

[21:19] Let therefore our most serene Lords give orders that nothing be collected with sin.

[21:20] And I know that, though less is given for the advantage of the republic, the republic is thereby much aided.

[21:21] And though perhaps it may be less aided by a less expenditure, yet it is better that we should not live temporally, than that you should find any hindrance in the way of eternal life.

[21:22] For consider what must be the  feelings, what the state of heart of parents, when they part with their children lest they should be tormented.

[21:23] But how one ought to feel for the children of others is well known to those who have children of their own.

[21:24] Let it then suffice for me to have briefly represented these things, lest, if your Piety were not to know what is being done in these parts, I should suffer for the guilt of my silence before the strict judge.

[22:1] Epistle XLII.

[22:2] To Sebastian, Bishop.

[22:3] Gregory to Sebastian, Bishop of Sirmium.

[22:4] I have received the most sweet and pleasant letter of thy Fraternity, which, though you are never absent from my heart, has nevertheless made your Holiness as it were present with me bodily.

[22:5] But I beseech Almighty God to protect you with His right hand, and to grant you a tranquil life here, and, when it shall please Him, eternal rewards.

[22:6] But I beg you, if you love me with that love wherewith you always loved me when we were together, to pray for me more earnestly, that so Almighty God may loose me from the bands of my sins, and make me to stand free in His sight, released from the burden of this corruption.

[22:7] For, however inestimable be the sweetness of the heavenly country for drawing one towards it, yet there are many sorrows in this life to impel us daily to the love of heavenly things.

[22:8] And these only please me exceedingly from the very fact that they do not allow anything to please me in this world.

[22:9] For we can by no means describe, most holy brother, what we suffer in this land at the hands of your friend, the lord Romanus.

[22:10] Yet I may briefly say that his malice towards us has surpassed the swords of the Lombards; so that the enemies who kill us seem kinder than the judges of the republic, who by their malice, rapines, and deceits wear us out with anxiety.

[22:11] And to bear at the same time the charge of bishops and clergy, and also of monasteries and people, and to watch anxiously against the plots of the enemy, and to be ever suspicious of the deceitfulness and malice of the dukes; what labours and what sorrows all this involves, your Fraternity may the more truly estimate as you more purely love me who suffer these things  Furthermore, while addressing you with the greeting that I owe you, I inform you that it has come to my knowledge from the report of Boniface the defensor, that our brother the most holy lord Anastasius the patriarch has wished to commit to you the government of the Church in one of his cities, and that you have refused your assent.

[22:12] This your feeling and your wisdom I most gladly approve of, and strongly commend; and I account you happy, and myself unhappy in having consented at such a time as this to undertake the government of the Church.

[22:13] If, however, by any chance, in condescension to your brethren, and as being intent on works of mercy, you should ever decide to consent to such a proposal, I beg you by no means to prefer any one else's love to mine.

[22:14] For there are in the island of Sicily Churches without bishops, and, if by the guidance of God you are pleased to take the government of a Church, you will be able to do this better near the threshold of the blessed apostle Peter, with his aid.

[22:15] But if you are not so pleased, remain happily as you are, that this resolution may continue in you; and pray for us unhappy ones.

[22:16] Now may Almighty God keep you under His protection, in whatever place it be His will that you should be, and bring you to heavenly rewards.

[23:1] Epistle XLIII.

[23:2] To Eulogius and Anastasius, Bishops.

[23:3] Gregory to Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria, and Anastasius, Bishop of Antioch.

[23:4] When the excellent preacher says, As long as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I will honour my ministry (Rom.

[23:5] xi.

[23:6] 13); saying again in another place, We became as babes among you (1 Thess.

[23:7] ii.

[23:8] 7), he undoubtedly shews an example to us who come after him, that we should retain humility in our minds, and yet keep in honour the dignity of our order, so that neither should our humility be timid nor our elevation proud.

[23:9] Now eight years ago, in the time of my predecessor of holy memory Pelagius, our brother and fellow-bishop John in the city of Constantinople, seeking occasion from another cause, held a synod in which he attempted to call himself Universal Bishop.

[23:10] Which as soon as my said predecessor knew, he despatched letters annulling by the authority of the holy apostle Peter the acts of the said synod; of which letters I have taken care to send copies to your Holiness.

[23:11] Moreover he forbade the deacon who attended us the most pious Lords for the business of the Church to celebrate the solemnities of mass with our aforesaid fellow-priest.

[23:12] I also, being of the same mind with him, have sent similar letters to our aforesaid fellow-priest, copies of which I have thought it right to send to your Blessedness, with this especial purpose, that we may first assail with moderate force the mind of our before-named brother concerning  this matter, wherein by a new act of pride, all the bowels of the Universal Church are disturbed.

[23:13] But, if he should altogether refuse to be bent from the stiffness of his elation, then, with the succour of Almighty God, we may consider more particularly what ought to be done.

[23:14] For, as your venerable Holiness knows, this name of Universality was offered by the holy synod of Chalcedon to the pontiff of the Apostolic See which by the providence of God I serve.

[23:15] But no one of my predecessors has ever consented to use this so profane a title; since, forsooth, if one Patriarch is called Universal, the name of Patriarch in the case of the rest is derogated.

[23:16] But far be this, far be it from the mind of a Christian, that any one should wish to seize for himself that whereby he might seem in the least degree to lessen the honour of his brethren.

[23:17] While, then, we are unwilling to receive this honour when offered to us, think how disgraceful it is for any one to have wished to usurp it to himself perforce.

[23:18] Wherefore let not your Holiness in your epistles ever call any one Universal, lest you detract from the honour due to yourself in offering to another what is not due.

[23:19] Nor let any sinister suspicion make your mind uneasy with regard to our most serene lords, inasmuch as he fears Almighty God, and will in no way consent to do anything against the evangelical ordinances, against the most sacred canons.

[23:20] As for me, though separated from you by long spaces of land and sea, I am nevertheless entirely conjoined with you in heart.

[23:21] And I trust that it is so in all respects with your Blessedness towards me; since, when you love me in return, you are not far from me.

[23:22] Hence we give thanks the more to that grain of mustard seed (Matth.

[23:23] xiii.

[23:24] 31, 32), for that from what appeared a small and despicable seed it has been so spread abroad everywhere by branches rising and extending themselves from the same root that all the birds of heaven may make their nests in them.

[23:25] And thanks be to that leaven which, in three measures of meal, has leavened in unity the mass of the whole human race (Matth.

[23:26] xiii.

[23:27] 33); and to the little stone, which, cut out of the mountain without hands, has occupied the whole face of the earth (Dan.

[23:28] ii.

[23:29] 35), and which to this end everywhere distends itself, that from the human race reduced to unity the body of the whole Church might be perfected, and so this distinction between the several members might serve for the benefit of the compacted whole.

[23:30] Hence also we are not far from you, since in Him who is everywhere we are one.

[23:31] Let us then give thanks to Him who, having abolished enmities, has caused that in His flesh there should be in the whole world one flock, and one sheepfold under Himself the one shepherd; and let us be ever mindful how the preacher of truth admonishes us, saying, Be careful to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace (Ephes.

[23:32] iv.

[23:33] 3), and, Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see God (Hebr.

[23:34] xii.

[23:35] 14).

[23:36] And he says also to other disciples, If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, having peace with all men (Rom.

[23:37] xii.

[23:38] 18).

[23:39] For he sees that the good cannot have peace with the bad; and therefore, as ye know, he premised, If it be possible.

[23:40] But, because peace cannot be established except on two sides, when the bad fly from it, the good ought to keep it in their inmost hearts.

[23:41] Whence also it is admirably said, As much as lieth in you; meaning that it should remain in us even when it is repelled from the hearts of evil men.

[23:42] And such peace we truly keep, when we treat the faults of the proud at once with charity and with persistent justice, when we love them and hate their vices.

[23:43] For man is the work of God; but vice is the work of man.

[23:44] Let us then distinguish between what God and what man has made, and neither hate the man on account of his error nor love the error on account of the man.

[23:45] Let us then with united mind attack the evil of pride in the man, that from his enemy, that is to say his error, the man himself may first be freed.

[23:46] Our Almighty Redeemer will supply strength to charity and justice; He will supply to us, though placed far from each other, the unity of His Spirit; even He by whose workmanship the Church, having been constructed as it were after the manner of the ark with the four sides of the world, and bound together with the compacture of incorruptible planks and the pitch of charity, is disturbed by no opposing winds, by the swelling of no billow coming from without.

[23:47] But inasmuch as, with His grace steering us, we ought to seek that no wave coming upon us from without may throw us into confusion, so ought we to pray with all our hearts, dearest brethren, that the right hand of His providence may draw out the accumulation of internal bilgewater within us.

[23:48] For indeed our adversary the devil, who, in his rage against the humble, as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour (1 Pet.

[23:49] v.

[23:50] 8), no longer, as we perceive, walks about the folds but so resolutely fixes his teeth in certain necessary members of the Church that, unless with the favour of the Lord, the heedful crowd  of shepherds unanimously run to the rescue, no one can doubt that he will soon tear all the sheepfold; which God forbid.

[23:51] Consider, dearest brethren, who it is that follows close at hand, of whose approach such perverse beginnings are breaking out even in priests.

[23:52] For it is because he is near of whom it is written, He is king over all the sons of pride (Job xli.

[23:53] 25)—not without sore grief I am compelled to say it—that our brother and fellow-bishop John, despising the Lord's commands, apostolical precepts, and rules of Fathers, attempts through elation to be his forerunner in name.

[23:54] But may Almighty God make known to your Blessedness with what sore groaning I am tormented by this consideration; that he, the once to me most modest man, he who was beloved of all, he who seemed to be occupied in alms, deeds, prayers, and fastings, out of the ashes he sat in, out of the humility he preached, has grown so boastful as to attempt to claim all to himself, and through the elation of a pompous expression to aim at subjugating to himself all the members of Christ, which cohere to one Head only, that is to Christ.

[23:55] Nor is it surprising that the same tempter who knows pride to be the beginning of all sin, who used it formerly before all else in the case of the first man, should now also put it before some men at the end of virtues, so as to lay it as a snare for those who to some extent seemed to be escaping his most cruel hands by the good aims of their life, at the very goal of good work, and as it were in the very conclusion of perfection.

[23:56] Wherefore we ought to pray earnestly, and implore Almighty God with continual supplications, that He would avert this error from that man's soul, and remove this mischief of pride and confusion from the unity and humility of the Church.

[23:57] And with the favour of the Lord we ought to concur, and make provision with all our powers, lest in the poison of one expression the living members in the body of Christ should die.

[23:58] For, if this expression is suffered to be allowably used, the honour of all patriarchs is denied: and while he that is called Universal perishes per chance in his error, no bishop will be found to have remained in a state of truth.

[23:59] It is for you then, firmly and without prejudice, to keep the Churches as you have received them, and not to let this attempt at a diabolical usurpation have any countenance from you.

[23:60] Stand firm; stand secure; presume not ever to issue or to receive writings with the falsity of the name Universal in them.

[23:61] Bid all the bishops subject to your care abstain from the defilement of this elation, that the Universal Church may acknowledge you as Patriarchs not only in good works but also in the authority of truth.

[23:62] But, if perchance adversity is the consequence, we ought to persist unanimously, and show even by dying that in case of harm to the generality we do not love anything of our own especially.

[23:63] Let us say with Paul, To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain (Philip.

[23:64] i.

[23:65] 21).

[23:66] Let us hear what the first of all pastors says; If ye suffer anything for righteousness' sake, happy are ye (1 Pet.

[23:67] iii.

[23:68] 14).

[23:69] For believe me that the dignity which we have received for the preaching of the truth we shall more safely relinquish than retain in behalf of the same truth, should case of necessity require it.

[23:70] Finally, pray for me, as becomes your most dear Blessedness, that I may shew forth in works what I am thus bold to say to you.

[24:1] Epistle XLVIII.

[24:2] To Andrew, Scholasticus.

[24:3] Gregory to Andrew, &c.

[24:4] We have been desirous of carrying out the wish of the most excellent the lord Patrician as to the person of Donatus, the archdeacon; but, seeing that it is very dangerous to the soul to lay hands on any one rashly, we took care to examine by a thorough investigation into his life and deeds.

[24:5] And, since many things have been discovered, as we have written to the said lord Patrician, which remove him far from the episcopate, we, fearing the judgment of God, have not thought fit to consent to his ordination.

[24:6] But neither have we presumed to ordain John, the presbyter, who is ignorant of the psalms, since this circumstance certainly shewed him to be too little in earnest about himself.

[24:7] These, then, being excluded, when we had urged the parties to choose some one from among their own people, and they declared that they had no one fit for this office, and when we together with them were the more distressed, they at length, with one common voice and consent, repeatedly solicited our venerable brother the presbyter Marinianus, who they learnt had been associated with me for a long time in a monastery.

[24:8] He, shrinking from the office, was at last, by various means, with difficulty persuaded to give assent to their petition.

[24:9] And, since we were well acquainted with his life, and knew him to be solicitous in winning souls, we did not delay his ordination.

[24:10] Let, therefore, your Glory receive him as is  becoming, and extend to his newness the aid of your succour.

[24:11] For to all, as you know, newness in any office whatever is very trying.

[24:12] But I have great confidence that Almighty God, who has vouchsafed to put him over His flock, will both stimulate him to give heed to what is inward, and comfort him with the loving-kindness of His grace for administering what is outward.

[24:13] But, inasmuch as, after his long enjoyment of quiet, his newness, as we have before said, will without doubt expose him to perturbation, I beg that, when he shall come to you flying from the whirlwinds of secular storms, he may always find in your heart a haven of rest, and be cheered by the boon of your charity.

[24:14] But you will soon learn how much you will find yourselves able to agree; for he comes unwillingly to the episcopate.

[25:1] Epistle XLIX.

[25:2] To Leander, Bishop.

[25:3] Gregory to Leander, Bishop of Hispalis (Seville).

[25:4] With what ardour I am athirst to see thee thou readest in the tables of thine own heart, since thou lovest me exceedingly.

[25:5] But since I cannot see thee, separated as thou art from me by long tracts of country, I have done what charity towards thee dictated, namely to transmit to thy Holiness, on the arrival here of our common son Probinus the presbyter, the book of Pastoral Rule, which I wrote at the commencement of my episcopate, and the books which thou knewest I had already composed on the exposition of the blessed Job.

[25:6] Some sheets indeed of the third and fourth parts of that work I have not sent to thy Charity, having already given those sheets only of the said parts to monasteries.

[25:7] These, then, which I send let thy Holiness earnestly peruse, and more earnestly deplore my sins, lest it be to my more serious blame that I am seen as it were to know what I omit to do.

[25:8] But with how great tumults of business I am oppressed in this Church the very brevity of my epistle will signify to thy Charity, seeing that I say so little to him whom more than all I love.

[26:1] Epistle LII.

[26:2] To John, Archbishop.

[26:3] Gregory to John, Archbishop of the Corinthians.

[26:4] The equity and solicitude of Secundinus our brother and fellow-bishop, which had been well known to us of old, is shewn also by the tenor of your letters.

[26:5] In this matter he has greatly pleased us, and made us glad, in that in the cause of Anastasius, once bishop, which we charged him to enquire into, he has both exercised his vigilance diligently and judged the crimes that were discovered as justice required, and as was right.

[26:6] But in all these things we return thanks to Almighty God for that, when certain accusers held back, He brought the truth to his knowledge, lest the originator of such great crimes should escape detection.

[26:7] But seeing that, in the sentence wherein it is evident that the above-named Anastasius has been justly condemned and deposed, our above-named brother and fellow-bishop has visited the offence of certain persons in such a manner as to reserve them for our judgment, we therefore have seen fit to signify by this present epistle what is to be held to and observed concerning them.

[26:8] As to Paul the deacon then, the bearer of these presents, although his fault is exceedingly to his shame and discredit—namely, that deluded by promises, he held back from accusation of his late bishop who has been lately deposed, and that, in the eagerness of cupidity, he consented, against his own soul, to keep silence rather than declare the truth—yet, since it befits us to be more kind than strict, we pardon him this fault, and decide that he is to be received again into his rank and position.

[26:9] For we believe that the affliction which he has endured since the time of the sentence being pronounced may suffice for the punishment of this fault.

[26:10] But as to Euphemius and Thomas, who received sacred orders for relinquishing their accusation, it is our will that they be deprived of these sacred orders, and, having been deposed from them, so continue; and we decree that they shall never, under any pretext or excuse, be restored to sacred orders.

[26:11] For it is in the highest degree improper, and contrary to the rule of ecclesiastical discipline, that they should enjoy the dignity which they have received, not for their merits, but as the reward of wickedness.

[26:12] Yet, inasmuch as it is fit for us to incline to mercy more than to strict justice, it is our will that the same Euphemius and Thomas be restored to the rank and position, but to that only, from which they had been promoted to sacred orders, and receive during all the days of their life the stipends of these positions, as they had been before accustomed.

[26:13] Further, as to Clematius the reader, I appoint, from a like motive of benignity, that he is to be restored  to his rank and position.

[26:14] To all these also, that is, to Paul the deacon, to Euphemius, Thomas, and Clematius, let your Fraternity take care to supply their emoluments, according to the rank and position in which each of them is, as each has been accustomed to receive them, from this present thirteenth indiction without any diminution.

[26:15] Inasmuch, therefore, as the above-named Paul the deacon asserts that he expended much for the advantage of your Church, and desires to be aided by the succour of your Fraternity for recovery of the same, we exhort that, if this is so, you should concur with him in all possible ways, and support him with your aid, for recovering what he has given, since no reason allows that he should unjustly suffer loss in what he has expended for the advantage of the generality.

[26:16] Furthermore, let your Fraternity restore without delay the three pounds of gold which, at the instance of our above-named brother and fellow-bishop Secundinus, it appears that the said Paul the deacon gave for the benefit of your Church, lest (which God forbid) you should seem to burden him, not reasonably, but out of mere caprice.

[27:1] Epistle LIII.

[27:2] To Virgilius, Bishop.

[27:3] Gregory to Virgilius, Bishop of Arelate (Arles).

[27:4] O how good is charity, which through an image in the mind exhibits what is absent as present to ourselves, through love unites what is divided, settles what is confused, associates things that are unequal, completes things that are imperfect! Rightly does the excellent preacher call it the bond of perfectness; since, though the other virtues indeed produce perfectness, yet still charity binds them together so that they can no longer be loosened from the heart of one who loves.

[27:5] Of this virtue, then, most dear brother, I find thee to be full, as both those who came from the Gallican parts and the words also of thy letter addressed to me testify to me of thee.

[27:6] Now as to thy having asked therein, according to ancient custom, for the use of the pallium and the vicariate of the Apostolic See, far be it from me to suspect that thou hast sought eminence of transitory power, or the adornment of external worship, in our vicariate and in the pallium.

[27:7] But, since it is well known to all whence the holy faith proceeded in the regions of Gaul, when your Fraternity asks for a repetition of the old custom of the Apostolic See, what is it but that a good offspring reverts to the bosom of its mother? With willing mind therefore we grant what has been asked for, lest we should seem either to withdraw from you anything of the honour due to you, or to have despised the petition of our most excellent son king Childebert.

[27:8] But the present state of things requires the greater earnestness, that with increase of dignity solicitude also may advance, and watchfulness in the custody of others may grow, and the merits of your life may serve as an example to your subjects, and that your Fraternity may never seek your own through the dignity accorded you, but the gains of the heavenly country.

[27:9] For you know what the blessed apostle says, groaning, For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's (Philip.

[27:10] ii.

[27:11] 21).

[27:12] For I have learnt from information given me by certain persons that in the parts of Gaul and Germany no one attains to holy orders except for a consideration given.

[27:13] If this is so, I say it with tears, I declare it with groans, that, when the priestly order has fallen inwardly, neither will it be able to stand outwardly for long.

[27:14] For we know from the Gospel what our Redeemer in person did; how He went into the temple, and overthrew the seats of them that sold doves (Matth.

[27:15] xxi.

[27:16] 12).

[27:17] For to sell doves is to receive a temporal consideration for the Holy Spirit, whom, being consubstantial with Himself, God Almighty gives to men through the imposition of hands.

[27:18] From which evil what follows is already intimated.

[27:19] For of those who presumed to sell doves in the temple of God the seats fell by God's judgment.

[27:20] And in truth this transgression is propagated with increase among subordinates.

[27:21] For he who is promoted to any sacred order for a price, being already corrupted in the very root of his advancement, is the more ready to sell to others what he has bought.

[27:22] And where is that which is written, Freely ye have received, freely give (Matth.

[27:23] x.

[27:24] 8)?  And, seeing that the simoniacal heresy was  the first to arise against the holy Church, why is it not considered, why is it not seen, that whoso ordains any one for money, causes him in advancing him, to become a heretic?  Another very detestable thing has also been reported to us; that some persons, being laymen, through desire of temporal glory, are tonsured on the death of bishops, and all at once are made priests.

[27:25] In such cases it is already known what manner of man he is who attains to priesthood, passing suddenly from a lay estate to sacred leadership.

[27:26] And one who has never served as a soldier fears not to become a leader of the religious.

[27:27] How is that man to preach who has perhaps never heard any one else preach? Or how shall he correct the ills of others who has never yet bewailed his own? And, where Paul the apostle prohibits a neophyte from coming to sacred orders, we are to understand that, as one was then called a neophyte who had been newly planted in the faith, so we now reckon among neophytes one who is still new in holy conversation.

[27:28] Moreover, we know that walls after being built, are not made to carry a weight of timber till they are dried of the moisture of their newness, lest, if a weight be put on them before they are settled, it bear down the whole fabric together to the ground.

[27:29] And, when we cut trees for a building, we wait for the moisture of their greenness to be first dried out, lest, if the weight of the fabric is imposed on them while still fresh, they be bent from their very newness, and be the sooner broken and fall down from having been elevated prematurely.

[27:30] Why, then, is not this scrupulously seen to among men, which is so carefully considered even in the case of timber and stones?  On this account your Fraternity must needs take care to admonish our most excellent son king Childebert that he remove entirely the stain of this sin from his kingdom, to the end that Almighty God may give him the greater recompense with Himself as He sees him both love what He loves and shun what He hates.

[27:31] And so we commit to your Fraternity, according to ancient custom, under God, our vicariate in the Churches which are under the dominion of our most excellent son Childebert, with the understanding that their proper dignity, according to primitive usage, be preserved to the several metropolitans.

[27:32] We have also sent a pallium for thy Fraternity to use within the Church for the solemnization of mass only.

[27:33] Further, if any one of the bishops should by any chance wish to travel to any considerable distance, let it not be lawful for him to remove to other places without the authority of thy Holiness.

[27:34] If any question of faith, or it may be relating to other matters, should have arisen among the bishops, which cannot easily be settled, let it be ventilated and decided in an assembly of twelve bishops.

[27:35] But, if it cannot be decided after the truth has been investigated, let it be referred to our judgment.

[27:36] Now may Almighty God keep you under His protection, and grant unto you to preserve by your behaviour the dignity that you have received.

[27:37] Given the 12th day of August, Indiction 13.

[28:1] Epistle LIV.

[28:2] To all the Bishops of the Kingdom of Childebert.

[28:3] Gregory to all the Bishops of Gaul who are under the kingdom of Childebert.

[28:4] To this end has the provision of the divine dispensation appointed that there should be diverse degrees and distinct orders, that, while the inferiors shew reverence to the more powerful and the more powerful bestow love on the inferiors, one contexture of concord may ensue of diversity, and the administration of all several offices may be properly borne.

[28:5] Nor indeed could the whole otherwise subsist; unless, that is, a great order of differences of this kind kept it together.

[28:6] Further, that creation cannot be governed, or live, in a state of absolute equality we are taught by the example of the heavenly hosts, since, there being angels and also archangels, it is manifest that they are not equal; but in power and rank, as you know, one differs from another.

[28:7] If then among these who are without sin there is evidently this distinction, who of men can refuse to submit himself willingly to this order of things which he knows that even angels obey? For hence peace and charity embrace each other mutually, and the sincerity of concord remains firm in the reciprocal love which is well pleasing to God.

[28:8] Since, then, each single duty is then salubriously fulfilled when there is one president who may be referred to, we have therefore perceived it to be opportune, in the Churches that are under the dominion of our most excellent  son king Childebert, to give our vicariate jurisdiction, according to ancient custom, to our brother Virgilius, bishop of the city of Arelate, to the end that the integrity of the catholic faith, that is of the four holy synods, may be preserved under the protection of God with attentive devotion, and that, if any contention should by chance arise among our brethren and fellow-priests, he may allay it by the rigour of his authority with discreet moderation, as representing the Apostolic See.

[28:9] We have also charged him that, if such a dispute should arise in any cases as to require the presence of others, he should assemble our brethren and fellow-bishops in competent number, and discuss the matter salubriously with due regard to equity, and decide it with canonical integrity.

[28:10] But if a contention (which may the Divine power avert) should happen to arise on matters of faith, or any business come up about which there may perchance be serious doubt, and he should be in need of the judgment of the Apostolic See in place of his own greatness, we have directed him that, having diligently enquired into the truth, he should take care to bring the question under our cognizance by a report from himself, to the end that it may be terminated by a suitable sentence so as to remove all doubt.

[28:11] And, since it is necessary that the bishops should assemble at suitable times for conference before him to whom we have granted our vicariate jurisdiction as often as he may think it, we exhort that none of you presume to be disobedient to his orders, or defer attending the general conclave, unless perchance bodily infirmity should prevent any one, or a just excuse in any case should allow his absence.

[28:12] Yet let such as are unavoidably prevented from attending the synod send a presbyter or a deacon in their stead, to the end that the things that, with the help of God, may be decided by our vicar, may come to the knowledge of him who is absent by a faithful report through the person whom he had sent, and be observed with unshaken steadfastness, and that there be no occasion of excuse for daring to violate them.

[28:13] About this also we take the precaution of warning you, that none of you may attempt in any way to depart to places at any great distance without the authority of our aforesaid brother and fellow-bishop Virgilius, knowing that the orders of our predecessors, who granted vicariate jurisdiction to his predecessors, undoubtedly lay this down.

[28:14] Furthermore, we exhort that each one of you give careful attention to his own office, so that he who desires to receive the reward promised for feeding the sheep may guard the flock committed to him with carefulness and prayer, lest the prowling wolf should invade and tear the sheep entrusted to him, and there should be in the retribution punishment instead of reward.

[28:15] We hope, therefore, most dear brethren, and we entreat Almighty God with all our prayers, that He would make you to be fervent more and more in the constancy of His love, and grant you especially to be retained in the peace of the Church, and in agreement together.

[28:16] It has been reported to us that some are promoted to sacred orders through simoniacal heresy; and we have ordered our above-written brother and fellow-bishop Virgilius that this must be altogether prohibited; and, that your Fraternity may know and studiously observe this, our letter to him is to be read in your presence.

[28:17] Given the 12th day of August, Indiction 13.

[29:1] Epistle LV.

[29:2] To King Childebert.

[29:3] Gregory to Childebert, king of the Franks.

[29:4] The letter of your Excellency has made us exceedingly glad, testifying as it does that you are careful, with pious affection, of the honour and reverence due to priests.

[29:5] For you thus shew to all that you are faithful worshippers of God, while you love His priests with the acceptable veneration that is due to them, and hasten with Christian devotion to do whatever may advance their position.

[29:6] Whence also we have received with pleasure what you have written, and grant what you desire with willing mind; and accordingly we have committed, with the favour of God, our vicariate jurisdiction to our brother Virgilius, bishop of the city of Arelate, according to ancient custom and your Excellency's desire; and have also granted him the use of the pallium, as has been the custom of old.

[29:7] But, inasmuch as some things have been reported to us which greatly offend Almighty God, and confound the honour and reverence due to the priesthood, we beg that they may be in every way amended with the support of the censure of your power, lest, while headstrong and perverse doings run counter to your devotion, your kingdom, or your soul (which God forbid) be burdened by the guilt of others.

[29:8] Further, it has come to our knowledge that on the death of bishops some persons from being laymen are tonsured, and mount to the episcopate by a sudden leap.

[29:9] And thus one  who has not been a disciple is in his inconsiderate ambition made a master.

[29:10] And, since he has not learned what to teach, he bears the office of priesthood only in name; for he continues to be a layman in speech and action as before.

[29:11] How, then, is he to intercede for the sins of others, not having in the first place bewailed his own? For such a shepherd does not defend, but deceives, the flock; since, while he cannot for very shame try to persuade others to do what he does not do himself, what else is it but that the Lord's people remains a prey to robbers, and catches destruction from the source whence it ought to have had a great support of wholesome protection? How bad and how perverse a proceeding this is let your Excellency's Highness consider even from your own administration of things.

[29:12] For it is certain that you do not put a leader over an army unless his work and his fidelity have first been apparent; unless the virtue and industry of his previous life have shewn him to be a fit person.

[29:13] But, if the command of an army is not committed to any but men of this kind, it is easily gathered from this comparison of what sort a leader of souls ought to be.

[29:14] But it is a reproach to us, and we are ashamed to say it, that priests snatch at leadership who have not seen the very beginning of religious warfare.

[29:15] But this also, a thing most execrable, has been reported to us as well: that sacred orders are conferred through simoniacal heresy, that is for bribes received.

[29:16] And, seeing that it is exceedingly pestiferous, and contrary to the Universal Church, that one be promoted to any sacred order not for merit but for a price, we exhort your Excellency to order so detestable a wickedness to be banished from your kingdom.

[29:17] For that man shows himself to be thoroughly unworthy of this office, who fears not to buy the gift of God with money, and presumes to try to get by payment what he deserves not to have through grace.

[29:18] These things, then, most excellent son, I admonish you about for this reason, that I desire your soul to be saved.

[29:19] And I should have written about them before now, had not innumerable occupations stood in the way of my will.

[29:20] But now that a suitable time for answering your letter has offered itself, I have not omitted what it was my duty to do.

[29:21] Wherefore, greeting your Excellency with the affection of paternal charity, we beg that all things which we have enjoined on our above-named brother and fellow-bishop to be done and observed, may be carried out under the protection of your favour, and that you allow them not to be in any way upset by the elation or pride of any one.

[29:22] But, as they were observed by his predecessor under the reign of your glorious father, so let them be observed now also, by your aid, with zealous devotion.

[29:23] It is right, then, that we should thus have a return made to us; and that, as we have not deferred fulfilling your will, so you too, for the sake of God and the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, should cause our ordinances to be observed in all respects; that so your Excellency's reputation, praiseworthy and well-pleasing to God, may extend itself all around.

[30:1] Epistle LVI.

[30:2] To Marinianus, Bishop.

[30:3] Gregory to Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna.

[30:4] Moved by the benevolence of the Apostolical See and the order of ancient custom, we have thought fit to grant the use of the pallium to thy Fraternity, who art known to have undertaken the office of government in the Church of Ravenna.

[30:5] And remember thou to use it in no other way but in the proper Church of thy city, when the sons (i-e: laity) have been already dismissed, as thou art proceeding from the audience chamber to celebrate the sacred solemnities of mass; but, when mass is finished, thou wilt take care to lay it by again in the audience chamber.

[30:6] But outside the Church, we do not allow thee to use it any more, except four times in the year, in the litanies which we named to thy predecessor John; giving thee at the same time this admonition; that, as through the Lord's bounty thou hast obtained from us the use of an adornment of this kind to the honour of the priestly office, so thou strive to adorn also the office undertaken by thee to the glory of Christ with probity of manners and of deeds.

[30:7] For thus wilt thou be conspicuous for two adornments answering to each other, if with such a vesture of the body as this the good qualities also of thy soul agree.

[30:8] For all privileges also which appear evidently to have been formerly granted to thy Church we confirm by our authority, and decree that they continue inviolate.

[31:1] Epistle LVII.

[31:2] To John, Bishop.

[31:3] Gregory to John, Bishop of the Corinthians  Now that our God, from whom nothing is hidden, having cast out an atrocious plague of pollution from the government of His Church,  has been pleased to advance you to the rule thereof, there is need of anxious precaution on your part that the Lord's flock, after the wounds and various evils inflicted by its former shepherd, may find consolation and wholesome medicine in your Fraternity.

[31:4] Thus, then, let the hand of your action wipe away the stain of the previous contagion, so as to suffer no traces even to remain of that execrable wickedness.

[31:5] Let, therefore, your solicitude towards your subjects be worthy of praise.

[31:6] Let discipline be exhibited with gentleness.

[31:7] Let rebuke be with discernment.

[31:8] Let kindness mitigate wrath; let zeal sharpen kindness: and let one be so seasoned with the other that neither immoderate punishment afflict more than it ought, nor again laxity impair the rectitude of discipline.

[31:9] Let the conduct of your Fraternity be a lesson to the people committed to you.

[31:10] Let them see in you what to love, and perceive what to make haste to imitate.

[31:11] Let them be taught how to live by your example.

[31:12] Let them not deviate from the straight course through your leading; let them find their way to God by following you; that so thou mayest receive as many rewards from the Saviour of the human race as thou shalt have won souls for Him.

[31:13] Labour therefore, most dear brother, and so direct the whole activity of thy heart and soul, that thou mayest hereafter be counted worthy to hear, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord (Matth.

[31:14] xxv.

[31:15] 21).

[31:16] As you requested in your letter which we received through our brother and fellow-bishop Andrew, we have sent you the pallium, which it is necessary that you should so use as your predecessors, by the allowance of our predecessors, are proved to have used it.

[31:17] Furthermore, it has come to our ears that in those parts no one attains to any sacred order without the giving of a consideration.

[31:18] If this, is so, I say with tears, I declare with groans, that, when the priestly order has fallen inwardly, neither will it stand long outwardly.

[31:19] For we know from the Gospel what our Redeemer in person did; how He went into the temple, and overthrew the seats of them that sold doves (Matth.

[31:20] xxi.

[31:21] 12).

[31:22] For to sell doves is to receive a temporal consideration for the Holy Spirit, whom, being consubstantial with Himself, Almighty God gives to men through imposition of hands.

[31:23] And what follows from this evil, as I have said before, is intimated; for the seats of those who presumed to sell doves in the temple of God fell by the judgment of God.

[31:24] And in truth this transgression is propagated with increase among subordinates.

[31:25] For one who attains to a sacred dignity tainted in the very root of his promotion is himself the more prepared to sell to others what he has bought.

[31:26] And where then is that which is written, Freely ye have received; freely give (Matth.

[31:27] x.

[31:28] 8)? And, since the simoniacal heresy was the first to arise against holy Church, why is it not considered, why is it not seen, that whosoever ordains any one for a price in promoting him causes him to become a heretic? Seeing, then, that the holy universal Church utterly condemns this most atrocious wickedness, we exhort your Fraternity in all ways to repress, with all the urgency of your solicitude, this so detestable and so huge a sin in all places that are under you.

[31:29] For, if we shall perceive anything of the kind to be done henceforth, we will correct it, not with words, but with canonical punishment; and we shall begin to have a different opinion of you; which ought not so to be.

[31:30] Further, your Fraternity knows that formerly the pallium was not given except for a consideration received.

[31:31] But, since this was incongruous, we held a council before the body of the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, and forbade under a strict interdiction the receiving of anything, as well for this as for ordinations.

[31:32] It is your duty then, that neither for a consideration, nor for favour or the solicitation of certain persons, you consent to any persons being advanced to sacred orders.

[31:33] For it is a grave sin, as we have said, and we cannot suffer it to continue without reproof.

[31:34] I delayed receiving the above named Andrew, our brother and fellow-bishop, because by the report of our brother and fellow-bishop Secundinus we learnt that he had forged letters, as to himself from us, in the proceedings against John of Larissa.

[31:35] And, unless your goodness had induced us, we would on no account have received him.

[32:1] Epistle LVIII.

[32:2] To all the Bishops throughout Helladia.

[32:3] Gregory to all bishops constituted in the province of Helladia.

[32:4] I return thanks with you, dearest brethren, to Almighty God, who has caused the hidden sore which the ancient enemy had introduced to come to the knowledge of all, and has cut it away by a wholesome incision from the body of His Church.

[32:5] Herein we have cause both to rejoice and to mourn; to rejoice, that is, for  the correction of a crime, but to mourn for the fall of a brother.

[32:6] But, since for the most part the fall of one is wont to be the safeguard of another, whosoever fears to fall, let him give heed to this, that he afford no way of approach to the enemy, nor think that deeds done lie hidden.

[32:7] For the Truth proclaims, There is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed (Matth.

[32:8] x.

[32:9] 26).

[32:10] For this voice is already the herald of our doings, and He himself, being witness, brings in all ways to public view what is done in secret.

[32:11] And who may strive to hide his deeds before Him Who is both their witness and their judge? But, since sometimes, when one thing is attended to, another is not guarded against, it behoves every one to be watchful against all the snares of the enemy, lest, while he conquers in one point he be vanquished in another.

[32:12] For an earthly enemy too, when he desires to invade fortified places, thus employs the art of warfare.

[32:13] For indeed he lays ambushes latently; but shews himself as though entirely bent on the storming of one place, so that, while there is a running together for defence of that place where the danger is imminent, other places about which there is no suspicion may be taken.

[32:14] And the result is, that he who, when perceived, was repulsed by the valour of his opponent, obtains by stealth what he could not obtain by fighting.

[32:15] But, since in all these things there is need of the aid of divine protection, let every one of us cry to the Lord with the voice of the heart, saying, Lord, remove not Thy help far from me; Look Thou to my defence (Ps.

[32:16] xxi.

[32:17] 20).

[32:18] For it is manifest that, unless He Himself should help, and defend those who cry to Him, our enemy cannot be vanquished.

[32:19] Furthermore, know ye that, having received the letter of your Charity through Andrew our brother and fellow-bishop, we have transmitted the pallium to John our brother, the bishop of the Corinthians; whom it is by all means fitting that you should obey, especially as the order of ancient custom claims this, and his good qualities, to which you yourselves bear testimony, invite it.

[32:20] For from the account given me by certain persons I have learnt that in those parts no one attains to any sacred order without the giving of a consideration.

[32:21] If this is so, I say with tears, I declare with groans, that, when the priestly order has fallen inwardly, neither will it be able to stand long outwardly.

[32:22] For we know from the Gospel what our Redeemer did in person; how He went into the temple, and overthrew the seats of them that sold doves.

[32:23] For in truth to sell doves is to receive a temporal consideration for the Holy Spirit, whom, being consubstantial with Himself, Almighty God gives to men through imposition of hands.

[32:24] And, as I have said before, what follows from this evil is intimated; for the seats of them that presumed to sell doves in the temple of God fell by God's judgment.

[32:25] And in truth this transgression is propagated with increase among subordinates.

[32:26] For he who is advanced to a sacred order already tainted in the very root of his promotion is himself more prepared to sell to others what he has bought.

[32:27] And where is that which is written, Freely ye have received; freely give (Matth.

[32:28] x.

[32:29] 8)? And, since the simoniacal heresy was the first to arise against the holy Church, why is it not considered, why is it not seen, that whosoever ordains any one for a price in promoting him causes him to become a heretic? And so we exhort that none of you suffer this to be done any more; or dare to promote any to sacred orders for the favour or supplication of any person, except such a one as the character of his life and actions has shewn to be worthy.

[32:30] For, if we should perceive the contrary in future, know ye that it will be repressed with strict and canonical punishment.

[32:31] Given on the 15th day of the month of August, Indiction 13.
