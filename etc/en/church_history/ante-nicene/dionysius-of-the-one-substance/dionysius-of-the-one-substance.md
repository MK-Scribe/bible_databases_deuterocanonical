# Dionysius: Of the One Substance

**[1:1]** Of the One Substance: VI.

**[1:2]** â€”Of the One Substance.

**[1:3]**   The plant that springs from the root is something distinct from that whence it grows up; and yet it is of one nature with it.

**[1:4]** And the river which flows from the fountain is something distinct from the fountain.

**[1:5]** For we cannot call either the river a fountain, or the fountain a river.

**[1:6]** Nevertheless we allow that they are both one according to nature, and also one in substance; and we admit that the fountain may be conceived of as father, and that the river is what is begotten of the fountain.
