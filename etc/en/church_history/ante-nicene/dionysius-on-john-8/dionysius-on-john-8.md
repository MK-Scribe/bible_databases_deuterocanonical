# Dionysius: On John VIII

**[1:1]** On John: V.

**[1:2]** â€”On John VIII.

**[1:3]**   Now this word "I am" expresses His eternal subsistence.

**[1:4]** For if He is the reflection of the eternal light, He must also be eternal Himself.

**[1:5]** For if the light subsists for ever, it is evident that the reflection also subsists for ever.

**[1:6]** And that this light subsists, is known only by its shining; neither can there be a light that does not give light.

**[1:7]** We come back, therefore, to our illustrations.

**[1:8]** If there is day, there is light; and if there is no such thing, the sun certainly cannot be present.

**[1:9]** If, therefore, the sun had been eternal, there would also have been endless day.

**[1:10]** Now, however, as it is not so, the day begins when the sun rises, and it ends when the sun sets.

**[1:11]** But God is eternal light, having neither beginning nor end.

**[1:12]** And along with Him there is the reflection, also without beginning, and everlasting.

**[1:13]** The Father, then, being eternal, the Son is also eternal, being light of light; and if God is the light, Christ is the reflection; and if God is also a Spirit, as it is written, "God is a Spirit," Christ, again, is called analogously Spirit.
