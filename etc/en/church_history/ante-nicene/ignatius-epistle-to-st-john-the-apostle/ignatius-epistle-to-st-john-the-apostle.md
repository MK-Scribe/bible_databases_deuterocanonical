# Ignatius: Epistle to St. John the Apostle

**[1:1]** The Epistle of Ignatius to Saint John the Apostle  Ignatius, and the brethren who are with him, to John the holy presbyter.

**[1:2]** We are deeply grieved at thy delay in strengthening us by thy addresses and consolations.

**[1:3]** If thy absence be prolonged, it will disappoint many of us.

**[1:4]** Hasten then to come, for we believe that it is expedient.

**[1:5]** There are also many of our women here, who are desirous to see Mary the mother of Jesus, and wish day by day to run off from us to you, that they may meet with her, and touch those breasts of hers which nourished the Lord Jesus, and may inquire of her respecting some rather secret matters.

**[1:6]** But Salome also, the daughter of Anna, whom thou lovest, who stayed with her five months at Jerusalem, and some other well-known persons, relate that she is full of all graces and all virtues, after the manner of a virgin, fruitful in virtue and grace.

**[1:7]** And, as they report, she is cheerful in persecutions and afflictions, free from murmuring in the midst of penury and want, grateful to those that injure her, and rejoices when exposed to troubles: she sympathizes with the wretched and the afflicted as sharing in their afflictions, and is not slow to come to their assistance.

**[1:8]** Moreover, she shines forth gloriously as contending in the fight of faith against the pernicious conflicts of vicious principles or conduct.

**[1:9]** She is the lady of our new religion and repentance, and the handmaid among the faithful of all works of piety.

**[1:10]** She is indeed devoted to the humble, and she humbles herself more devotedly than the devoted, and is wonderfully magnified by all, while at the same time she suffers detraction from the Scribes and Pharisees.

**[1:11]** Besides these points, many relate to us numerous other things regarding her.

**[1:12]** We do not, however, go so far as to believe all in every particular; nor do we mention such to thee.

**[1:13]** But, as we are informed by those who are worthy of credit, there is in Mary the mother of Jesus an angelic purity of nature allied with the nature of humanity.

**[1:14]** And such reports as these have greatly excited our emotions, and urge us eagerly to desire a sight of this (if it be lawful so to speak) heavenly prodigy and most sacred marvel.

**[1:15]** But do thou in haste comply with this our desire; and fare thou well, Amen.
