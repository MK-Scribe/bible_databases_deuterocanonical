# Ignatius: Reply of the Blessed Virgin

**[1:1]** Reply of the Blessed Virgin to this Letter.

**[1:2]** The lowly handmaid of Christ Jesus to Ignatius, her beloved fellow-disciple.

**[1:3]** The things which thou hast heard and learned from John concerning Jesus are true.

**[1:4]** Believe them, cling to them, and hold fast the profession of that Christianity which thou hast embraced, and conform thy habits and life to thy profession.

**[1:5]** Now I will come in company with John to visit thee, and those that are with thee.

**[1:6]** Stand fast in the faith, and show thyself a man; nor let the fierceness of persecution move thee, but let thy spirit be strong and rejoice in God thy Saviour, Amen.
