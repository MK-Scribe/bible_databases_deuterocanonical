# Methodius: Banquet of the Ten Virgins - Thekla

**[1:1]** Thekla: Chapter I.

**[1:2]** —Methodius' Derivation of the Word Virginity: Wholly Divine; Virtue, in Greek—ἀρετή, Whence So Called.

**[1:3]** Well, then, let us first say, beginning from the origin of the name, for what cause this supreme and blessed pursuit was called παρθενία, what it aims at, what power it has, and afterwards, what fruits it gives forth.

**[1:4]** For almost all have been ignorant of this virtue as being superior to ten thousand other advantages of virtue which we cultivate for the purification and adornment of the soul.

**[1:5]** For virginity is divine by the change of one letter, as she alone makes him who has her, and is initiated by her incorruptible rites like unto God, than which it is impossible to find a greater good, removed, as it is, from pleasure and grief; and the wing of the soul sprinkled by it becomes stronger and lighter, accustomed daily to fly from human desires.

**[1:6]** For since the children of the wise have said that our life is a festival, and that we have come to exhibit in the theatre the drama of truth, that is, righteousness, the devil and the demons plotting and striving against us, it is necessary for us to look upwards and to take our flight aloft, and to flee from the blandishments of their tongues, and from their forms tinged with the outward appearance of temperance, more than from the Sirens of Homer.

**[1:7]** For many, bewitched by the pleasures of error, take their flight downwards, and are weighed down when they come into this life, their nerves being relaxed and unstrung, by means of which the power of the wings of temperance is strengthened, lightening the downward tendency of the corruption of the body.

**[1:8]** Whence, O Arete, whether thou hast thy name, signifying virtue, because thou art worthy of being chosen for thyself, or because thou raisest and liftest up to heaven, ever going in the purest minds, come, give me thy help in my discourse, which thou hast thyself appointed me to speak.

**[2:1]** Chapter II.

**[2:2]** —The Lofty Mind and Constancy of the Sacred Virgins; The Introduction of Virgins into the Blessed Abodes Before Others.

**[2:3]** Those who take a downward flight, and fall into pleasures, do not desist from grief and labours until, through their passionate desires, they fulfil the want of their intemperance, and, being degraded and shut out from the sanctuary, they are removed from the scene of truth, and, instead of procreating children with modesty and temperance, they rave in the wild pleasures of unlawful amours.

**[2:4]** But those who, on light wing, ascend into the supramundane life, and see from afar what other men do not see, the very pastures of immortality, bearing in abundance flowers of inconceivable beauty, are ever turning themselves again to the spectacles there; and, for this reason, those things are thought small which are here considered noble—such as wealth, and glory, and birth, and marriage; and they think no more of those things.

**[2:5]** But yet if any of them should choose to give up their bodies to wild beasts or to fire, and be punished, they are ready to have no care for pains, for the desire of them or the fear of them; so that they seem, while in the world, not to be in the world, but to have already reached, in thought and in the tendency of their desires, the assembly of those who are in heaven.

**[2:6]** Now it is not right that the wing of virginity should, by its own nature, be weighed down upon the earth, but that it should soar upwards to heaven, to a pure atmosphere, and to the life which is akin to that of angels.

**[2:7]** Whence also they, first of all, after their call and departure hence, who have rightly and faithfully contended as virgins for Christ, bear away the prize of victory, being crowned by Him with the flowers of immortality.

**[2:8]** For, as soon as their souls have left the world, it is said that the angels meet them with much rejoicing, and conduct them to the very pastures already spoken of, to which also they were longing to come, contemplating them in imagination from afar, when, while they were yet dwelling in their bodies, they appeared to them divine.

**[3:1]** Chapter III.

**[3:2]** —The Lot and Inheritance of Virginity.

**[3:3]** Furthermore, when they have come hither, they see wonderful and glorious and blessed things of beauty, and such as cannot be spoken to men.

**[3:4]** They see there righteousness itself and prudence, and love itself, and truth and temperance, and other flowers and plants of wisdom, equally splendid, of which we here behold only the shadows and apparitions, as in dreams, and think that they consist of the actions of men, because there is no clear image of them here, but only dim copies, which themselves we see often when making dark copies of them.

**[3:5]** For never has any one seen with his eyes the greatness or the form or the beauty of righteousness itself, or of understanding, or of peace; but there, in Him whose name is I AM, they are seen perfect and clear, as they are.

**[3:6]** For there is a tree of temperance itself, and of love, and of understanding, as there are plants of the fruits which grow here—as of grapes, the pomegranate, and of apples; and so, too, the fruits of those trees are gathered and eaten, and do not perish and wither, but those who gather them grow to immortality and a likeness to God.

**[3:7]** Just as he from whom all are descended, before the fall and the blinding of his eyes, being in paradise, enjoyed its fruits, God appointing man to dress and to keep the plants of wisdom.

**[3:8]** For it was entrusted to the first Adam to cultivate those fruits.

**[3:9]** Now Jeremiah saw that these things exist specially in a certain place, removed to a great distance from our world, where, compassionating those who have fallen from that good state, he says: "Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that thou mayest know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.

**[3:10]** Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into her treasures?" The virgins having entered into the treasures of these things, gather the reasonable fruits of the virtues, sprinkled with manifold and well-ordered lights, which, like a fountain, God throws up over them, irradiating that state with unquenchable lights.

**[3:11]** And they sing harmoniously, giving glory to God.

**[3:12]** For a pure atmosphere is shed over them, and one which is not oppressed by the sun.

**[4:1]** Chapter IV.

**[4:2]** —Exhortation to the Cultivation of Virginity; A Passage from the Apocalypse is Proposed to Be Examined.

**[4:3]** Now, then, O Virgins, daughters of undefiled temperance, let us strive for a life of blessedness and the kingdom of heaven.

**[4:4]** And do ye unite with those before you in an earnest desire for the same glory of chastity, caring little for the things of this life.

**[4:5]** For immortality and chastity do not contribute a little to happiness, raising up the flesh aloft, and drying up its moisture and its clay-like weight, by a greater force of attraction.

**[4:6]** And let not the uncleanness which you hear creep in and weigh you down to the earth; nor let sorrow transform your joy, melting away your hopes in better things; but shake off incessantly the calamities which come upon you, not defiling your mind with lamentations.

**[4:7]** Let faith conquer wholly, and let its light drive away the visions of evil which crowd around the heart.

**[4:8]** For, as when the moon brightly shining fills the heaven with its light, and all the air becomes clear, but suddenly the clouds from the west, enviously rushing in, for a little while overshadow its light, but do not destroy it, since they are immediately driven away by a blast of the wind; so ye also, when causing the light of chastity to shine in the world, although pressed upon by afflictions and labours, do not grow weary and abandon your hopes.

**[4:9]** For the clouds which come from the Evil One are driven away by the Spirit, if ye, like your Mother, who gives birth to the male Virgin in heaven, fear nothing the serpent that lies in wait and plots against you; concerning whom I intend to discourse to you more plainly; for it is now time.

**[4:10]** John, in the course of the Apocalypse, says: "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: and she, being with child, cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.

**[4:11]** And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

**[4:12]** And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

**[4:13]** And she brought forth a man-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.

**[4:14]** And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days".

**[4:15]** So far we have given, in brief, the history of the woman and the dragon.

**[4:16]** But to search out and explain the solution of them is beyond my powers.

**[4:17]** Nevertheless, let me venture, trusting in Him who commanded to search the Scriptures.

**[4:18]** If, then, you agree with this, it will not be difficult to undertake it; for you will quite pardon me, if I am unable sufficiently to explain the exact meaning of the Scripture.

**[5:1]** Chapter V.

**[5:2]** —The Woman Who Brings Forth, to Whom the Dragon is Opposed, the Church; Her Adornment and Grace.

**[5:3]** The woman who appeared in heaven clothed with the sun, and crowned with twelve stars, and having the moon for her footstool, and being with child, and travailing in birth, is certainly, according to the accurate interpretation, our mother, O virgins, being a power by herself distinct from her children; whom the prophets, according to the aspect of their subjects, have called sometimes Jerusalem, sometimes a Bride, sometimes Mount Zion, and sometimes the Temple and Tabernacle of God.

**[5:4]** For she is the power which is desired to give light in the prophet, the Spirit crying to her: "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.

**[5:5]** For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee.

**[5:6]** And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.

**[5:7]** Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side".

**[5:8]** It is the Church whose children shall come to her with all speed after the resurrection, running to her from all quarters.

**[5:9]** She rejoices receiving the light which never goes down, and clothed with the brightness of the Word as with a robe.

**[5:10]** For with what other more precious or honourable ornament was it becoming that the queen should be adorned, to be led as a Bride to the Lord, when she had received a garment of light, and therefore was called by the Father? Come, then, let us go forward in our discourse, and look upon this marvelous woman as upon virgins prepared for a marriage, pure and undefiled, perfect and radiating a permanent beauty, wanting nothing of the brightness of light; and instead of a dress, clothed with light itself; and instead of precious stones, her head adorned with shining stars.

**[5:11]** For instead of the clothing which we have, she had light; and for gold and brilliant stones, she had stars; but stars not such as those which are set in the invisible heaven, but better and more resplendent, so that those may rather be considered as their images and likenesses.

**[6:1]** Chapter VI.

**[6:2]** —The Works of the Church, the Bringing Forth of Children in Baptism; The Moon in Baptism, the Full Moon of Christ's Passion.

**[6:3]** Now the statement that she stands upon the moon, as I consider, denotes the faith of those who are cleansed from corruption in the laver of regeneration, because the light of the moon has more resemblance to tepid water, and all moist substance is dependent upon her.

**[6:4]** The Church, then, stands upon our faith and adoption, under the figure of the moon, until the fulness of the nations come in, labouring and bringing forth natural men as spiritual men; for which reason too she is a mother.

**[6:5]** For just as a woman receiving the unformed seed of a man, within a certain time brings forth a perfect man, in the same way, one should say, does the Church conceive those who flee to the Word, and, forming them according to the likeness and form of Christ, after a certain time produce them as citizens of that blessed state.

**[6:6]** Whence it is necessary that she should stand upon the laver, bringing forth those who are washed in it.

**[6:7]** And in this way the power which she has in connection with the laver is called the moon, because the regenerate shine being renewed with a new ray, that is, a new light.

**[6:8]** Whence, also, they are by a descriptive term called newly-enlightened; the moon ever showing forth anew to them the spiritual full moon, namely, the period and the memorial of the passion, until the glory and the perfect light of the great day arise.

**[7:1]** Chapter VII.

**[7:2]** —The Child of the Woman in the Apocalypse Not Christ, But the Faithful Who are Born in the Laver.

**[7:3]** If any one, for there is no difficulty in speaking distinctly, should be vexed, and reply to what we have said: "But how, O virgins, can this explanation seem to you to be according to the mind of Scripture, when the Apocalypse plainly defines that the Church brings forth a male, while you teach that her labour-pains have their fulfilment in those who are washed in the laver?" We will answer, But, O faultfinder, not even to you will it be possible to show that Christ Himself is the one who is born.

**[7:4]** For long before the Apocalypse, the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word was fulfilled.

**[7:5]** And John speaks concerning things present and things to come.

**[7:6]** But Christ, long ago conceived, was not caught up to the throne of God when He was brought forth, from fear of the serpent injuring Him.

**[7:7]** But for this was He begotten, and Himself came down from the throne of the Father, that He should remain and subdue the dragon who made an assault upon the flesh.

**[7:8]** So that you also must confess that the Church labours and gives birth to those who are baptized.

**[7:9]** As the spirit says somewhere in Isaiah: "Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.

**[7:10]** Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children".

**[7:11]** From whom did he flee? Surely from the dragon, that the spiritual Zion might bear a masculine people, who should come back from the passions and weakness of women to the unity of the Lord, and grow strong in manly virtue.

**[8:1]** Chapter VIII.

**[8:2]** —The Faithful in Baptism Males, Configured to Christ; The Saints Themselves Christs.

**[8:3]** Let us then go over the ground again from the beginning, until we come in course to the end, explaining what we have said.

**[8:4]** Consider if the passage seems to you to be explained to your mind.

**[8:5]** For I think that the Church is here said to give birth to a male; since the enlightened receive the features, and the image, and the manliness of Christ, the likeness of the form of the Word being stamped upon them, and begotten in them by a true knowledge and faith, so that in each one Christ is spiritually born.

**[8:6]** And, therefore, the Church swells and travails in birth until Christ is formed in us, so that each of the saints, by partaking of Christ, has been born a Christ.

**[8:7]** According to which meaning it is said in a certain scripture, "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm," as though those who were baptized into Christ had been made Christs by communication of the Spirit, the Church contributing here their clearness and transformation into the image of the Word.

**[8:8]** And Paul confirms this, teaching it plainly, where he says: "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".

**[8:9]** For it is necessary that the word of truth should be imprinted and stamped upon the souls of the regenerate.

**[9:1]** Chapter IX.

**[9:2]** —The Son of God, Who Ever Is, is To-Day Begotten in the Minds and Sense of the Faithful.

**[9:3]** Now, in perfect agreement and correspondence with what has been said, seems to be this which was spoken by the Father from above to Christ when He came to be baptized in the water of the Jordan, "Thou art my son: this day have I begotten thee;" for it is to be remarked that He was declared to be His Son unconditionally, and without regard to time; for He says "Thou art," and not "Thou hast become," showing that He had neither recently attained to the relation of Son, nor again, having begun before, after this had an end, but having been previously begotten, that He was to be, and was the same.

**[9:4]** But the expression, "This day have I begotten thee," signifies that He willed that He who existed before the ages in heaven should be begotten on the earth—that is, that He who was before unknown should be made known.

**[9:5]** Now, certainly, Christ has never yet been born in those men who have never perceived the manifold wisdom of God—that is, has never been known, has never been manifested, has never appeared to them.

**[9:6]** But if these also should perceive the mystery of grace, then in them too, when they were converted and believed, He would be born in knowledge and understanding.

**[9:7]** Therefore from hence the Church is fitly said to form and beget the male Word in those who are cleansed.

**[9:8]** So far I have spoken according to my ability concerning the travail of the Church; and here we must change to the subject of the dragon and the other matters.

**[9:9]** Let us endeavour, then, to explain it in some measure, not deterred by the greatness of the obscurity of the Scripture; and if anything difficult comes to be considered, I will again help you to cross it like a river.

**[10:1]** Chapter X.

**[10:2]** —The Dragon, the Devil; The Stars Struck from Heaven by the Tail of the Dragon, Heretics; The Numbers of the Trinity, that Is, the Persons Numbered; Errors Concerning Them.

**[10:3]** The dragon, which is great, and red, and cunning, and manifold, and seven-headed, and horned, and draws down the third part of the stars, and stands ready to devour the child of the woman who is travailing, is the devil, who lies in wait to destroy the Christ-accepted mind of the baptized, and the image and clear features of the Word which had been brought forth in them.

**[10:4]** But he misses and fails of his prey, the regenerate being caught up on high to the throne of God—that is, the mind of those who are renovated is lifted up around the divine seat and the basis of truth against which there is no stumbling, being taught to look upon and regard the things which are there, so that it may not be deceived by the dragon weighing them down.

**[10:5]** For it is not allowed to him to destroy those whose thoughts and looks are upwards.

**[10:6]** And the stars, which the dragon touched with the end of his tail, and drew them down to earth, are the bodies of heresies; for we must say that the stars, which are dark, obscure, and falling, are the assemblies of the heterodox; since they, too, wish to be acquainted with the heavenly ones, and to have believed in Christ, and to have the seat of their soul in heaven, and to come near to the stars as children of light.

**[10:7]** But they are dragged down, being shaken out by the folds of the dragon, because they did not remain within the triangular forms of godliness, falling away from it with respect to an orthodox service.

**[10:8]** Whence also they are called the third part of the stars, as having gone astray with regard to one of the three Persons of the Trinity.

**[10:9]** As when they say, like Sabellios, that the Almighty Person of the Father Himself suffered; or as when they say, like Artemas, that the Person of the Son was born and manifested only in appearance; or when they contend, like the Ebionites, that the prophets spoke of the Person of the Spirit, of their own motion.

**[10:10]** For of Marcion and Valentinus, and those about Elkesaios and others, it is better not even to make mention.

**[11:1]** Chapter XI.

**[11:2]** —The Woman with the Male Child in the Wilderness the Church; The Wilderness Belongs to Virgins and Saints; The Perfection of Numbers and Mysteries; The Equality and Perfection of the Number Six; The Number Six Related to Christ; From This Number, Too, the Creation and Harmony of the World Completed.

**[11:3]** Now she who brings forth, and has brought forth, the masculine Word in the hearts of the faithful, and who passed, undefiled and uninjured by the wrath of the beast, into the wilderness, is, as we have explained, our mother the Church.

**[11:4]** And the wilderness into which she comes, and is nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days, which is truly waste and unfruitful of evils, and barren of corruption, and difficult of access and of transit to the multitude; but fruitful and abounding in pasture, and blooming and easy of access to the holy, and full of wisdom, and productive of life, is this most lovely, and beautifully wooded and well-watered abode of Arete.

**[11:5]** Here the south wind awakes, and the north wind blows, and the spices flow out, and all things are filled with refreshing dews, and crowned with the unfading plants of immortal life; in which we now gather flowers, and weave with sacred fingers the purple and glorious crown of virginity for the queen.

**[11:6]** For the Bride of the Word is adorned with the fruits of virtue.

**[11:7]** And the thousand two hundred and sixty days that we are staying here, O virgins, is the accurate and perfect understanding concerning the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, in which our mother increases, and rejoices, and exults throughout this time, until the restitution of the new dispensation, when, coming into the assembly in the heavens, she will no longer contemplate the I AM through the means of human knowledge, but will clearly behold entering in together with Christ.

**[11:8]** For a thousand, consisting of a hundred multiplied by ten, embraces a full and perfect number, and is a symbol of the Father Himself, who made the universe by Himself, and rules all things for Himself.

**[11:9]** Two hundred embraces two perfect numbers united together, and is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, since He is the Author of our knowledge of the Son and the Father.

**[11:10]** But sixty has the number six multiplied by ten, and is a symbol of Christ, because the number six proceeding from unity is composed of its proper parts, so that nothing in it is wanting or redundant, and is complete when resolved into its parts.

**[11:11]** Thus it is necessary that the number six, when it is divided into even parts by even parts, should again make up the same quantity from its separated segments.

**[11:12]** For, first, if divided equally, it makes three; then, if divided into three parts, it makes two; and again, if divided by six, it makes one, and is again collected into itself.

**[11:13]** For when divided into twice three, and three times two, and six times one, when the three and the two and the one are put together, they complete the six again.

**[11:14]** But everything is of necessity perfect which neither needs anything else in order to its completion, nor has anything over.

**[11:15]** Of the other numbers, some are more than perfect, as twelve.

**[11:16]** For the half of it is six, and the third four, and the fourth three, and the sixth two, and the twelfth one.

**[11:17]** The numbers into which it can be divided, when put together, exceed twelve, this number not having preserved itself equal to its parts, like the number six.

**[11:18]** And those which are imperfect, are numbers like eight.

**[11:19]** For the half of it is four, and the fourth two, and the eighth one.

**[11:20]** Now the numbers into which it is divided, when put together, make seven, and one is wanting to its completion, not being in all points harmonious with itself, like six, which has reference to the Son of God, who came from the fulness of the Godhead into a human life.

**[11:21]** For having emptied Himself, and taken upon Him the form of a slave, He was restored again to His former perfection and dignity.

**[11:22]** For He being humbled, and apparently degraded, was restored again from His humiliation and degradation to His former completeness and greatness, having never been diminished from His essential perfection.

**[11:23]** Moreover, it is evident that the creation of the world was accomplished in harmony with this number, God having made heaven and earth, and the things which are in them, in six days; the word of creative power containing the number six, in accordance with which the Trinity is the maker of bodies.

**[11:24]** For length, and breadth, and depth make up a body.

**[11:25]** And the number six is composed of triangles.

**[11:26]** On these subjects, however, there is not sufficient time at present to enlarge with accuracy, for fear of letting the main subject slip, in considering that which is secondary.

**[12:1]** Chapter XII.

**[12:2]** —Virgins are Called to the Imitation of the Church in the Wilderness Overcoming the Dragon.

**[12:3]** The Church, then, coming hither into this wilderness, a place unproductive of evils, is nourished, flying on the heavenward wings of virginity, which the Word called the "wings of great eagle," having conquered the serpent, and driven away from her full moon the wintry clouds.

**[12:4]** It is for the sake of these things, meanwhile, that all these discourses are held, teaching us, O fair virgins, to imitate according to our strength our mother, and not to be troubled by the pains and changes and afflictions of life, that you may enter in exulting with her into the bride-chamber, showing your lamps.

**[12:5]** Do not, therefore, lose courage on account of the schemes and slanders of the beast, but bravely prepare for the battle, armed with the helmet of salvation, and the breastplate, and the greaves.

**[12:6]** For you will bring upon him an immense consternation when you attack him with great advantage and courage; nor will he at all resist, seeing his adversaries set in array by One more powerful; but the many-headed and many-faced beast will immediately allow you to carry off the spoils of the seven contests:—  "Lion in front, but dragon all behind,  And in the midst a she-goat breathing forth  Profuse the violence of flaming fire.

**[12:7]** Her slew Bellerophon in truth.

**[12:8]** And this  Slew Christ the King; for many she destroyed,  Nor could they bear the fetid foam which burst  From out the fountain of her horrid jaws;"  unless Christ had first weakened and overcome her, making her powerless and contemptible before us.

**[13:1]** Chapter XIII.

**[13:2]** —The Seven Crowns of the Beast to Be Taken Away by Victorious Chastity; The Ten Crowns of the Dragon, the Vices Opposed to the Decalogue; The Opinion of Fate the Greatest Evil.

**[13:3]** Therefore, taking to you a masculine and sober mind, oppose your armour to the swelling beast, and do not at all give way, nor be troubled because of his fury.

**[13:4]** For you will have immense glory if you overcome him, and take away the seven crowns which are upon him, on account of which we have to struggle and wrestle, according to our teacher Paul.

**[13:5]** For she who having first overcome the devil, and destroyed his seven heads, becomes possessed of the seven crowns of virtue, having gone through the seven great struggles of chastity.

**[13:6]** For incontinence and luxury is a head of the dragon; and whoever bruises this is wreathed with the crown of temperance.

**[13:7]** Cowardice and weakness is also a head; and he who treads upon this carries off the crown of martyrdom.

**[13:8]** Unbelief and folly, and other similar fruits of wickedness, is another head; and he who has overcome these and destroyed them carries off the honours connected with them, the power of the dragon being in many ways rooted up.

**[13:9]** Moreover, the ten horns and stings which he was said to have upon his heads are the ten opposites, O virgins, to the Decalogue, by which he was accustomed to gore and cast down the souls of many imagining and contriving things in opposition to the law, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God," and to the other precepts which follow.

**[13:10]** Consider now the fiery and bitter horn of fornication, by which he casts down the incontinent; consider adultery, consider falsehood, covetousness, theft, and the other sister and related vices, which flourish by nature around his murderous heads, which if you root out with the aid of Christ, you will receive, as it were, divine heads, and will bloom with the crowns gained from the dragon.

**[13:11]** For it is our duty to prefer and to set forward the best things, who have received, above the earth-born, a commanding and voluntary mind, and one free from all necessity, so as to make choice like masters of the things which please us, not being in bondage to fate or fortune.

**[13:12]** And so no man would be master of himself and good, unless selecting the human example of Christ, and bringing himself to the likeness of Him, he should imitate Him in his manner of life.

**[13:13]** For of all evils the greatest which is implanted in many is that which refers the causes of sins to the motions of the stars, and says that our life is guided by the necessities of fate, as those say who study the stars, with much insolence.

**[13:14]** For they, trusting more in guessing than in prudence, that is, in something between truth and falsehood, go far astray from the sight of things as they are.

**[13:15]** Whence, if you permit me, O Arete, now that I have completed the discourse which you, my mistress, appointed to be spoken, I will endeavour, with your assistance and favour, to examine carefully the position of those who are offended, and deny that we speak the truth, when we say that man is possessed of free-will, and prove that  "They perish self-destroyed,  By their own fault,"  choosing the pleasant in preference to the expedient.

**[13:16]** Arete.

**[13:17]** I do permit you and assist you; for your discourse will be perfectly adorned when you have added this to it.

**[14:1]** Chapter XIV.

**[14:2]** —The Doctrine of Mathematicians Not Wholly to Be Despised, When They are Concerned About the Knowledge of the Stars; The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac Mythical Names.

**[14:3]** Thekla.

**[14:4]** Resuming then, let us first lay bare, in speaking of those things according to our power, the imposture of those who boast as though they alone had comprehended from what forms the heaven is arranged, in accordance with the hypothesis of the Chaldeans and Egyptians.

**[14:5]** For they say that the circumference of the world is likened to the turnings of a well-rounded globe, the earth having a central point.

**[14:6]** For its outline being spherical, it is necessary, they say, since there are the same distances of the parts, that the earth should be the centre of the universe, around which, as being older, the heaven is whirling.

**[14:7]** For if a circumference is described from the central point, which seems to be a circle,—for it is impossible for a circle to be described without a point, and it is impossible for a circle to be without a point,—surely the earth consisted before all, they say, in a state of chaos and disorganization.

**[14:8]** Now certainly the wretched ones were overwhelmed in the chaos of error, "because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened;" and their wise men said that nothing earth-born was more honourable or more ancient than the Olympians.

**[14:9]** Whence they are not mere children who know Christ, like the Greeks, who, burying the truth in fairies and fictions, rather than in artistic words, ascribing human calamities to the heavens, are not ashamed to describe the circumference of the world by geometrical theorems and figures, and explain that the heaven is adorned with the images of birds and of animals that live in water and on dry land, and that the qualities of the stars were made from the calamities of the men of old, so that the movements of the planets, in their opinion, depended upon the same kind of bodies.

**[14:10]** And they say that the stars revolve around the nature of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, being drawn along by the passage of the circle of the Zodiac, so that through their intermingling they see the things which happen to many, according to their conjunctions and departures, their rising and setting.

**[14:11]** For the whole heaven being spherical, and having the earth for its central point, as they think, because all the straight lines from the circumference falling upon the earth are equal to one another, holds back from the circles which surround it, of which the meridian is the greatest; and the second, which divides it into two equal parts, is the horizon; and the third, which separates these, the equinoctial; and on each side of this the two tropics, the summer and the winter—the one on the north, and the other on the south.

**[14:12]** Beyond is that which is called the axis, around which are the greater and lesser Bears, and beyond them is the tropic.

**[14:13]** And the Bears, turning about themselves, and weighing upon the axis, which passes through the poles, produce the motion of the whole world, having their heads against each other's loins, and being untouched by our horizon.

**[14:14]** Then they say that the Zodiac touches all the circles, making its movements diagonally, and that there are in it a number of signs, which are called the twelve signs of the Zodiac, beginning with the Ram, and going on to the Fishes, which, they say, were so determined from mythical causes; saying that it was the Ram that conveyed Helle, the daughter of Athamas, and her brother Phryxos into Scythia; and that the head of the Ox is in honour of Zeus, who, in the form of a Bull, carried over Europe into Crete; and they say the circle called the Galaxy, or milky way, which reaches from the Fishes to the Ram, was poured forth for Herakles from the breasts of Hera, by the commands of Zeus.

**[14:15]** And thus, according to them, there was no natal destiny before Europe or Phryxos, and the Dioscuroi, and the other signs of the Zodiac, which were placed among the constellations, from men and beasts.

**[14:16]** But our ancestors lived without destiny.

**[14:17]** Let us endeavour now to crush falsehood, like physicians, taking its edge off, and quenching it with the healing medicine of words, here considering the truth.

**[15:1]** Chapter XV.

**[15:2]** —Arguments from the Novelty of Fate and Generation; That Golden Age, Early Men; Solid Arguments Against the Mathematicians.

**[15:3]** If it were better, O wretched ones, that man should be subject to the star of his birth, than that he should not, why was not his generation and birth from the very time when the race of man began to be? And if it was, what is the need of those which had lately been placed among the stars, of the Lion, the Crab, the Twins, the Virgin, the Bull, the Balance, the Scorpion, the Ram, the Archer, the Fishes, the Goat, the Watercarrier, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Pegasus, Hydra, the Raven, the Cup, the Lyre, the Dragon, and others, from which you introduce, by your instructions, many to the knowledge of mathematics, or, rather, to a knowledge which is anathema? Well, then, either there was generation among those before, and the removal of these creatures above was absurd; or else there was not, and God changed human life into a better state and government than that of those who before that lived an inferior life.

**[15:4]** But the ancients were better than those of the present time; whence theirs was called the golden age.

**[15:5]** There was then no natal destiny.

**[15:6]** If the sun, driving through the circles and passing along the signs of the Zodiac in his annual periods, accomplishes the changes and turnings of the seasons, how did those who were born before the signs of the Zodiac were placed among the stars, and the heaven was adorned with them, continue to exist, when summer, autumn, winter, and spring, were not as yet separated from each other, by means of which the body is increased and strengthened? But they did exist, and were longer lived and stronger than those who live now, since God then disposed the seasons in the same manner.

**[15:7]** The heaven was not then diversified by such shapes.

**[15:8]** If the sun and the moon and the other stars were made for the division and protection of the members of the time, and for the adornment of the heaven, and the changes of the seasons, they are divine, and better than men; for these must needs pass a better life, and a blessed and peaceful one, and one which far exceeds our own life in righteousness and virtue, observing a motion which is well-ordered and happy.

**[15:9]** But if they are the causes of the calamities and mischief of mortals, and busy themselves in working the lasciviousness, and the changes and vicissitudes of life, then they are more miserable than men, looking upon the earth, and their weak and lawless actions, and doing nothing better than men, if at least our life depends upon their revolutions and movements.

**[16:1]** Chapter XVI.

**[16:2]** —Several Other Things Turned Against the Same Mathematicians.

**[16:3]** If no action is performed without a previous desire, and there is no desire without a want, yet the Divine Being has no wants, and therefore has no conception of evil.

**[16:4]** And if the nature of the stars be nearer in order to that of God, being better than the virtue of the best men, then the stars also are neither productive of evil, nor in want.

**[16:5]** And besides, every one of those who are persuaded that the sun and moon and stars are divine, will allow that they are far removed from evil, and incapable of human actions which spring from the sense of pleasure and pain; for such abominable desires are unsuitable to heavenly beings.

**[16:6]** But if they are by nature exempt from these, and in no want of anything, how should they be the causes to men of those things which they do not will themselves, and from which they are exempt?  Now those who decide that man is not possessed of free-will, and affirm that he is governed by the unavoidable necessities of fate, and her unwritten commands, are guilty of impiety towards God Himself, making Him out to be the cause and author of human evils.

**[16:7]** For if He harmoniously orders the whole circular motion of the stars, with a wisdom which man can neither express nor comprehend, directing the course of the universe; and the stars produce the qualities of virtue and vice in human life, dragging men to these things by the chains of necessity; then they declare God to be the Cause and Giver of evils.

**[16:8]** But God is the cause of injury to no one; therefore fate is not the cause of all things.

**[16:9]** Whoever has the least intelligence will confess that God is good, righteous, wise, true, helpful, not the cause of evils, free from passion, and everything of that kind.

**[16:10]** And if the righteous be better than the unrighteous, and unrighteousness be abominable to them, God, being righteous, rejoices in righteousness, and unrighteousness is hateful to Him, being opposed and hostile to righteousness.

**[16:11]** Therefore God is not the author of unrighteousness.

**[16:12]** If that which profits is altogether good, and temperance is profitable to one's house and life and friends, then temperance is good.

**[16:13]** And if temperance be in its nature good, and licentiousness be opposed to temperance, and that which is opposed to good be evil, then licentiousness is evil.

**[16:14]** And if licentiousness be in its nature evil, and out of licentiousness come adulteries, thefts, quarrels, and murders, then a licentious life is in its nature evil.

**[16:15]** But the Divine Being is not by nature implicated in evils.

**[16:16]** Therefore our birth is not the cause of these things.

**[16:17]** If the temperate are better than the incontinent, and incontinence is abominable to them, and God rejoices in temperance, being free from the knowledge of passions, then incontinence is hateful also to God.

**[16:18]** Moreover, that the action which is in accordance with temperance, being a virtue, is better than that which is in accordance with incontinence, which is a vice, we may learn from kings and rulers, and commanders, and women, and children, and citizens, and masters, and servants, and pedagogues, and teachers; for each of these is useful to himself and to the public when he is temperate; but when he is licentious he is injurious to himself and to the public.

**[16:19]** And if there be any difference between a filthy man and a noble man, a licentious and a temperate; and if the character of the noble and the temperate be the better, and that of the opposite the worse; and if those of the better character be near to God and His friends, and those of the worse be far from Him and His enemies, those who believe in fate make no distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness, between filthiness and nobility, between licentiousness and temperance, which is a contradiction.

**[16:20]** For if good be opposed to evil, and unrighteousness be evil, and this be opposed to righteousness and righteousness be good, and good be hostile to evil, and evil be unlike to good, then righteousness is different from unrighteousness.

**[16:21]** And therefore God is not the cause of evils, nor does He rejoice in evils.

**[16:22]** Nor does reason commend them, being good.

**[16:23]** If, then, any are evil, they are evil in accordance with the wants and desires of their minds, and not by necessity.

**[16:24]** "They perish self-destroyed,  By their own fault".

**[16:25]** If destiny leads one on to kill a man, and to stain his hands with murder, and the law forbids this, punishing criminals, and by threats restrains the decrees of destiny, such as committing injustice, adultery, theft, poisoning, then the law is in opposition to destiny; for those things which destiny appointed the law prohibits, and those things which the law prohibits destiny compels men to do.

**[16:26]** Hence law is hostile to destiny.

**[16:27]** But if it be hostile, then lawgivers do not act in accordance with destiny; for by passing decrees in opposition to destiny they destroy destiny.

**[16:28]** Either, then, there is destiny and there was no need of laws; or there are laws and they are not in accordance with destiny.

**[16:29]** But it is impossible that anyone should be born or anything done apart from destiny; for they say it is not lawful for anyone even to move a finger apart from fate.

**[16:30]** And therefore it was in accordance with destiny that Minos and Dracon, and Lycurgus, and Solon, and Zaleukos were law-givers and appointed laws, prohibiting adulteries, murders, violence, rape, thefts, as things which neither existed nor took place in accordance with destiny.

**[16:31]** But if these things were in accordance with destiny, then the laws were not in accordance with destiny.

**[16:32]** For destiny itself would not be destroyed by itself, cancelling itself, and contending against itself; here appointing laws forbidding adultery and murders, and taking vengeance upon and punishing the wicked, and there producing murders and adulteries.

**[16:33]** But this is impossible: for nothing is alien and abhorrent to itself, and self-destructive, and at variance with itself.

**[16:34]** And, therefore, there is no destiny.

**[16:35]** If everything in the world falls out in accordance with destiny, and nothing without it, then the law must needs be produced by destiny.

**[16:36]** But the law destroys destiny, teaching that virtue should be learnt, and diligently performed; and that vice should be avoided, and that it is produced by want of discipline.

**[16:37]** Therefore there is no destiny.

**[16:38]** If destiny makes men to injure one another, and to be injured by one another, what need is there of laws? But if laws are made that they may check the sinful, God having a care for those who are injured, it were better that the evil should not act in accordance with Fate, than that they should be set right, after having acted.

**[16:39]** But God is good and wise, and does what is best.

**[16:40]** Therefore there is no fixed destiny.

**[16:41]** Either education and habit are the cause of sins, or the passions of the soul, and those desires which arise through the body.

**[16:42]** But whichever of these be the cause, God is not the cause.

**[16:43]** If it is better to be righteous than to be unrighteous, why is not man made so at once from his birth? But if afterwards he is tempered by instruction and laws, that he may become better, he is so tempered as possessing free-will, and not by nature evil.

**[16:44]** If the evil are evil in accordance with destiny, by the decrees of Providence, they are not blameworthy and deserving of the punishment which is inflicted by the laws, since they live according to their own nature, and are not capable of being changed.

**[16:45]** And, again, if the good, living according to their own proper nature, are praiseworthy, their natal destiny being the cause of their goodness; yet the wicked, living according to their own proper nature, are not blamable in the eye of a righteous judge.

**[16:46]** For, if we must speak plainly, he who lives according to the nature which belongs to him, in no way sins.

**[16:47]** For he did not make himself thus, but Fate; and he lives according to its motion, being urged on by unavoidable necessity.

**[16:48]** Then no one is bad.

**[16:49]** But some men are bad: and vice is blameworthy, and hostile to God, as reason has shown.

**[16:50]** But virtue is lovable and praiseworthy, God having appointed a law for the punishment of the wicked.

**[16:51]** Therefore there is no Fate.

**[17:1]** Chapter XVII.

**[17:2]** —The Lust of the Flesh and Spirit: Vice and Virtue.

**[17:3]** But why do I draw out my discourse to such length, spending the time with arguments, having set forth the things which are most necessary for persuasion, and to gain approval for that which is expedient; and having made manifest to all, by a few words, the inconsistency of their trick, so that it is now possible even for a child to see and perceive their error; and that to do good or evil is in our own power, and not decided by the stars.

**[17:4]** For there are two motions in us, the lust of the flesh and that of the soul, differing from each other, whence they have received two names, that of virtue and that of vice.

**[17:5]** And we ought to obey the most noble and most useful leading of virtue, choosing the best in preference to the base.

**[17:6]** But enough on these points.

**[17:7]** I must come to the end of my discourse; for I fear, and am ashamed, after these discourses on chastity, that I should be obliged to introduce the opinions of men who study the heavens, or rather who study nonsense, who waste their life with mere conceits, passing it in nothing but fabulous figments.

**[17:8]** And now may these offerings of ours, composed from the words which are spoken by God, be acceptable to thee, O Arete, my mistress.

**[17:9]** Euboulios.

**[17:10]** How bravely and magnificently, O Gregorion, has Thekla debated!  Gregorion.

**[17:11]** What, then, would you have said, if you had listened to herself, speaking fluently, and with easy expression, with much grace and pleasure? So that she was admired by every one who attended, her language blossoming with words, as she set forth intelligently, and in fact picturesquely, the subjects on which she spoke, her countenance suffused with the blush of modesty; for she is altogether brilliant in body and soul.

**[17:12]** Euboulios.

**[17:13]** Rightly do you say this, Gregorion, and none of these things is false; for I knew her wisdom also from other noble actions, and what sort of things she succeeded in speaking, giving proof of supreme love to Christ; and how glorious she often appeared in meeting the chief conflicts of the martyrs, procuring for herself a zeal equal to her courage, and a strength of body equal to the wisdom of her counsels.

**[17:14]** Gregorion.

**[17:15]** Most truly do you also speak.

**[17:16]** But let us not waste time; for we shall often be able to discuss these and other subjects.

**[17:17]** But I must now first relate to you the discourses of the other virgins which followed, as I promised; and chiefly those of Tusiane and Domnina; for these still remain.

**[17:18]** When, then, Thekla ceased speaking these things, Theopatra said that Arete directed Tusiane to speak; and that she, smiling, passed before her and said.
