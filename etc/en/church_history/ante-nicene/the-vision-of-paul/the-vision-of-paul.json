And I said, Sir, how did David alone above the other saints make a beginning of psalm-singing?  And the angel answered and said unto me:  Because Christ the Son of God sits at the right hand of His Father, and this David sings psalms before him in the seventh heaven, and as is done in the heavens so also below, because the host may not be offered to God without David, but it is necessary that David should sing psalms in the hour of the oblation of the body and blood of Christ:  as it is performed in heaven so also on earth."
