For when we have drawn two, between which there is scarce room for a needle's point, we are no longer able, even in imagination, to draw  others between, so that they shall arrive at the centre without any commixture; whereas reason exclaims that innumerable lines can be drawn, without being able to touch each other except in the centre, so that in every interval between them even a circle could be described."
