# Ambrose: On the Duties of the Clergy Book II

**[1:1]** On the Duties of the Clergy Book II: Chapter I.

**[1:2]** Happiness in life is to be gained by living virtuously, inasmuch as thus a Christian, whilst despising glory and the favour of men, desires to please God alone in what he does.

**[1:3]** 1.

**[1:4]** In the first book we spoke of the duties which we thought befitted a virtuous life, whereon no one has ever doubted but that a blessed life, which the Scripture calls eternal life, depends.

**[1:5]** So great is the splendour of a virtuous life that a peaceful conscience and a calm innocence work out a happy life.

**[1:6]** And as the risen sun hides the globe of the moon and the light of the stars, so the brightness of a virtuous life, where it glitters in true pure glory, casts into the shade all other things, which, according to the desires of the body, are considered to be good, or are reckoned in the eyes of the world to be great and noble.

**[1:7]** 2.

**[1:8]** Blessed, plainly, is that life which is not valued at the estimation of outsiders, but is known, as judge of itself, by its own inner feelings.

**[1:9]** It needs no popular opinion as its reward in any way; nor has it any fear of punishments.

**[1:10]** Thus the less it strives for glory, the more it rises above it.

**[1:11]** For to those who seek for glory, that reward in the shape of present things is but a shadow of future ones, and is a hindrance to eternal life, as it is written in the Scriptures: "Verily, I say unto you, they have received their reward".

**[1:12]** This is said of those who, as it were, with the sound of a trumpet desire to make known to all the world the liberality they exercise towards the poor.

**[1:13]** It is the same, too, in the case of fasting,  which is done but for outward show.

**[1:14]** "They have," he says, "their reward".

**[1:15]** 3.

**[1:16]** It therefore belongs to a virtuous life to show mercy and to fast in secret; that thou mayest seem to be seeking a reward from thy God alone, and not from men.

**[1:17]** For he who seeks it from man has his reward, but he who seeks it from God has eternal life, which none can give but the Lord of Eternity, as it is said: "Verily, I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise".

**[1:18]** Wherefore the Scripture plainly has called that life which is blessed, eternal life.

**[1:19]** It has not been left to be appraised according to man's ideas on the subject, but has been entrusted to the divine judgment.

**[2:1]** Chapter II.

**[2:2]** The different ideas of philosophers on the subject of happiness.

**[2:3]** He proves, first, from the Gospel that it rests on the knowledge of God and the pursuit of good works; next, that it may not be thought that this idea was adopted from the philosophers, he adds proofs from the witness of the prophets.

**[2:4]** 4.

**[2:5]** The philosophers have made a happy life to depend, either (as Hieronymus) on freedom from pain, or (as Herillus) on knowledge.

**[2:6]** For Herillus, hearing knowledge very highly praised by Aristotle and Theophrastus, made it alone to be the chief good, when they really praised it as a good thing, not as the only good; others, as Epicurus, have called pleasure such; others, as Callipho, and after him Diodorus, understood it in such a way as to make a virtuous life go in union, the one with pleasure, the other with freedom from pain, since a happy life could not exist without it.

**[2:7]** Zeno, the Stoic, thought the highest and only good existed in a virtuous life.

**[2:8]** But Aristotle and Theophrastus and the other Peripatetics maintained that a happy life consisted in virtue, that is, in a virtuous life, but that its happiness was made complete by the advantages of the body and other external good things.

**[2:9]** 5.

**[2:10]** But the sacred Scriptures say that eternal life rests on a knowledge of divine things and on the fruit of good works.

**[2:11]** The Gospel bears witness to both these statements.

**[2:12]** For the Lord Jesus spoke thus of knowledge: "This is eternal life, to know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent".

**[2:13]** About works He gives this answer: "Every one that hath forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My Name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit everlasting life".

**[2:14]** 6.

**[2:15]** Let no one think that this was but lately said, and that it was spoken of by the philosophers before it was mentioned in the Gospel.

**[2:16]** For the philosophers, that is to say, Aristotle and Theophrastus, as also Zeno and Hieronymus, certainly lived before the time of the Gospel; but they came after the prophets.

**[2:17]** Let them rather think how long before even the names of the philosophers were heard of, both of these seem to have found open expression through the mouth of the holy David; for it is written: "Blessed is the man whom Thou instructest, O Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law".

**[2:18]** We find elsewhere also: "Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, he will rejoice greatly in His commandments".

**[2:19]** We have proved our point as regards knowledge, the reward for which the prophet states to be the fruit of eternity, adding that in the house of the man that feareth the Lord, or is instructed in His law and rejoices greatly in the divine commandments, "is glory and riches; and his justice abideth for ever and ever".

**[2:20]** He has further also in the same psalm stated of good works, that they gain for an upright man the gift of eternal life.

**[2:21]** He speaks thus: "Blessed is the man that showeth pity and lendeth, he will guide his affairs with discretion, surely he shall not be moved for ever, the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance".

**[2:22]** And further: "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his justice endureth for ever".

**[2:23]** 7.

**[2:24]** Faith, then, has [the promise of] eternal life, for it is a good foundation.

**[2:25]** Good works, too, have the same, for an upright man is tested by his words and acts.

**[2:26]** For  if a man is always busy talking and yet is slow to act, he shows by his acts how worthless his knowledge is: besides it is much worse to know what one ought to do, and yet not to do what one has learnt should be done.

**[2:27]** On the other hand, to be active in good works and unfaithful at heart is as idle as though one wanted to raise a beautiful and lofty dome upon a bad foundation.

**[2:28]** The higher one builds, the greater is the fall; for without the protection of faith good works cannot stand.

**[2:29]** A treacherous anchorage in a harbour perforates a ship, and a sandy bottom quickly gives way and cannot bear the weight of the building placed upon it.

**[2:30]** There then will be found the fulness of reward, where the virtues are perfect, and where there is a reasonable agreement between words and acts.

**[3:1]** Chapter III.

**[3:2]** The definition of blessedness as drawn from the Scriptures is considered and proved.

**[3:3]** It cannot be enhanced by external good fortune, nor can it be weakened by misfortune.

**[3:4]** 8.

**[3:5]** As, then, knowledge, so far as it stands alone, is put aside either as worthless, according to the superfluous discussions of the philosophers, or as but an imperfect idea, let us now note how clearly the divine Scriptures explain a thing about which we see the philosophers held so many involved and perplexing ideas.

**[3:6]** For the Scriptures state that nothing is good but what is virtuous, and declare that virtue is blessed in every circumstance, and that it is never enhanced by either corporal or other external good fortune, nor is it weakened by adversity.

**[3:7]** No state is so blessed as that wherein one is free from sin, is filled with innocence, and is fully supplied with the grace of God.

**[3:8]** For it is written: "Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and hath not stood in the way of sinners, and hath not sat in the seat of pestilence, but in the law of the Lord was his delight".

**[3:9]** And again: "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord".

**[3:10]** 9.

**[3:11]** Innocence, then, and knowledge make a man blessed.

**[3:12]** We have also noted already that the blessedness of eternal life is the reward for good works.

**[3:13]** It remains, then, to show that when the patronage of pleasure or the fear of pain is despised (and the first of these one abhors as poor and effeminate, and the other as unmanly and weak), that then a blessed life can rise up in the midst of pain.

**[3:14]** This can easily be shown when we read: "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you for righteousness' sake.

**[3:15]** Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you".

**[3:16]** And again: "He that will come after Me, let him take up his cross and follow Me".

**[4:1]** Chapter IV.

**[4:2]** The same argument, namely, that blessedness is not lessened or added to by external matters, is illustrated by the example of men of old.

**[4:3]** 10.

**[4:4]** There is, then, a blessedness even in pains and griefs.

**[4:5]** All which virtue with its sweetness checks and restrains, abounding as it does in natural resources for either soothing conscience or increasing grace.

**[4:6]** For Moses was blessed in no small degree when, surrounded by the Egyptians and shut in by the sea, he found by his merits a way for himself and the people to go through the waters.

**[4:7]** When was he ever braver than at the moment when, surrounded by the greatest dangers, he gave not up the hope of safety, but besought a triumph?  11.

**[4:8]** What of Aaron? When did he ever think himself more blessed than when he stood between the living and the dead, and by his presence stayed death from passing from the bodies of the dead to the lines of the living? What shall I say of the youth Daniel, who was so wise that, when in the midst of the lions enraged with hunger, he was by no means overcome with terror at the fierceness of the beasts.

**[4:9]** So free from fear was he, that he could eat, and was not afraid he might by his example excite the animals to feed on him.

**[4:10]** 12.

**[4:11]** There is, then, in pain a virtue that can display the sweetness of a good conscience, and therefore it serves as a proof that pain does not lessen the pleasure of virtue.

**[4:12]** As, then, there is no loss of blessedness to virtue through pain, so also the pleasures of the body and the enjoyment that benefits give add nothing to it.

**[4:13]** On this the Apostle says well: "What things to me were gain, those I counted loss for Christ," and he added: "Wherefore I count all things but loss, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ".

**[4:14]** 13.

**[4:15]** Moses, too, thought the treasures of Egypt to be his loss, and thus showed forth in his life the reproach of the Cross of the Lord.

**[4:16]** He was not rich when he had abundance of money, nor was he afterwards poor when he was in want of food, unless, perchance, there is any one who thinks he was less happy when daily food was wanting to him and his people in the wilderness.

**[4:17]** But yet manna, that is, angels' food, which surely none will dare deny to be a mark of the greatest good and of blessedness, was given him from heaven; also the daily shower of meat was sufficient to feed the whole multitude.

**[4:18]** 14.

**[4:19]** Bread for food also failed Elijah, that holy man, had he sought for it; but it seemed not to fail him because he sought it not.

**[4:20]** Thus by the daily service of the ravens bread was brought to him in the morning, meat in the evening.

**[4:21]** Was he any the less blessed because he was poor to himself? Certainly not.

**[4:22]** Nay, he was the more blessed, for he was rich toward God.

**[4:23]** It is better to be rich for others than for oneself.

**[4:24]** He was so, for in the time of famine he asked a widow for food, intending to repay it, so that the barrel of meal failed not for three years and six months, and the oil jar sufficed and served the needy widow for her daily use all that time also.

**[4:25]** Rightly did Peter wish to be there where he saw them.

**[4:26]** Rightly did they appear in the mount with Christ in glory, for He Himself became poor when He was rich.

**[4:27]** 15.

**[4:28]** Riches, then, give no assistance to living a blessed life, a fact that the Lord clearly shows in the Gospel, saying: "Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.

**[4:29]** Blessed are they that hunger and thirst now, for they shall be filled.

**[4:30]** Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh".

**[4:31]** Thus it is stated as plainly as possible that poverty, hunger, and pain, which are considered to be evils, not only are not hindrances to a blessed life, but are actually so many helps toward it.

**[5:1]** Chapter V.

**[5:2]** Those things which are generally looked on as good are mostly hindrances to a blessed life, and those which are looked on as evil are the materials out of which virtues grow.

**[5:3]** What belongs to blessedness is shown by other examples.

**[5:4]** 16.

**[5:5]** But those things which seem to be good, as riches, abundance, joy without pain, are a hindrance to the fruits of blessedness, as is clearly stated in the Lord's own words, when He said: "Woe to you rich, for ye have received your consolation! Woe unto you that are full, for ye shall hunger, and to those who laugh, for they shall mourn!" So, then, corporal or external good things are not only no assistance to attaining a blessed life, but are even a hindrance to it.

**[5:6]** 17.

**[5:7]** Wherefore Naboth was blessed, even though he was stoned by the rich; weak and poor, as opposed to the royal resources, he was rich in his aim and his religion; so rich, indeed, that he would not exchange the inheritance of the vineyard received from his father for the king's money; and on this account was he perfect, for he defended the rights of his forefathers with his own blood.

**[5:8]** Thus, also, Ahab was wretched on his own showing, for he caused the poor man to be put to death, so as to take possession of his vineyard himself.

**[5:9]** 18.

**[5:10]** It is quite certain that virtue is the only and the highest good; that it alone richly abounds in the fruit of a blessed life; that a blessed life, by means of which eternal life is won, does not depend on external or corporal benefits, but on virtue only.

**[5:11]** A blessed life is the fruit of the present, and eternal life is the hope of the future.

**[5:12]** 19.

**[5:13]** Some, however, there are who think a blessed life is impossible in this body, weak and fragile as it is.

**[5:14]** For in it one must suffer pain and grief, one must weep, one must be ill.

**[5:15]** So I could also say that a blessed life rests on bodily rejoicing, but not on the heights of wisdom, on the sweetness of conscience, or on the loftiness of virtue.

**[5:16]** It is not a blessed thing to be in the midst of suffering; but it is blessed to be victorious over it, and not to be cowed by the power of temporal pain.

**[5:17]** 20.

**[5:18]** Suppose that things come which are accounted terrible as regards the grief they cause, such as blindness, exile, hunger, violation of a daughter, loss of children.

**[5:19]** Who will deny that Isaac was blessed, who did not see in his old age, and yet gave blessings with his benediction? Was not Jacob blessed who, leaving his father's house, endured exile as a shepherd for pay, and mourned for the violated chastity of his daughter, and suffered hunger? Were they not blessed on whose good faith God received witness, as it is written: "The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the  God of Jacob"? A wretched thing is slavery, but Joseph was not wretched; nay, clearly he was blessed, when he whilst in slavery checked the lusts of his mistress.

**[5:20]** What shall I say of holy David who bewailed the death of three sons, and, what was even worse than this, his daughter's incestuous connection? How could he be unblessed from whom the Author of blessedness Himself sprung, Who has made many blessed? For: "Blessed are they who have not seen yet have believed".

**[5:21]** All these felt their own weakness, but they bravely prevailed over it.

**[5:22]** What can we think of as more wretched than holy Job, either in the burning of his house, or the instantaneous death of his ten sons, or his bodily pains? Was he less blessed than if he had not endured those things whereby he really showed himself approved?  21.

**[5:23]** True it is that in these sufferings there is something bitter, and that strength of mind cannot hide this pain.

**[5:24]** I should not deny that the sea is deep because inshore it is shallow, nor that the sky is clear because sometimes it is covered with clouds, nor that the earth is fruitful because in some places there is but barren ground, nor that the crops are rich and full because they sometimes have wild oats mingled with them.

**[5:25]** So, too, count it as true that the harvest of a happy conscience may be mingled with some bitter feelings of grief.

**[5:26]** In the sheaves of the whole of a blessed life, if by chance any misfortune or bitterness has crept in, is it not as though the wild oats were hidden, or as though the bitterness of the tares was concealed by the sweet scent of the corn? But let us now proceed again with our subject.

**[6:1]** Chapter VI.

**[6:2]** On what is useful: not that which is advantageous, but that which is just and virtuous.

**[6:3]** It is to be found in losses, and is divided into what is useful for the body, and what is useful unto godliness.

**[6:4]** 22.

**[6:5]** In the first book we made our division in such a way as to set in the first place what is virtuous and what is seemly; for all duties are derived from these.

**[6:6]** In the second place we set what is useful.

**[6:7]** But as at the start we said that there was a difference between what is virtuous and what is seemly—which one can comprehend more easily than one can explain—so also when we are thinking of what is useful, we have to give considerable thought to what is the more useful.

**[6:8]** 23.

**[6:9]** But we do not reckon usefulness by the value of any gain in money, but in acquiring godliness, as the Apostle says: "But godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come".

**[6:10]** Thus in the holy Scriptures, if we look carefully we shall often find that what is virtuous is called useful: "All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not profitable" [useful].

**[6:11]** Before that he was speaking of vices, and so means: It is lawful to sin, but it is not seemly.

**[6:12]** Sins rest in one's own power, but they are not virtuous.

**[6:13]** To live wantonly is easy, but it is not right.

**[6:14]** For food serves not God but the belly.

**[6:15]** 24.

**[6:16]** Therefore, because what is useful is also just, it is just to serve Christ, Who redeemed us.

**[6:17]** They too are just who for His Name's sake have given themselves up to death, they are unjust who have avoided it.

**[6:18]** Of them it says: What profit is there in my blood? that is: what advance has my justice made? Wherefore they also say: "Let us bind the just, for he is useless to us," that is: he is unjust, for he complains of us, condemns and rebukes us.

**[6:19]** This could also be referred to the greed of impious men, which closely resembles treachery; as we read in the case of the traitor Judas, who in his longing for gain and his desire for money put his head into the noose of treachery and fell.

**[6:20]** 25.

**[6:21]** We have then to speak of that usefulness which is full of what is virtuous, as the Apostle himself has laid it down in so many words, saying: "And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely".

**[6:22]** It is plain, then, that what is virtuous is useful, and what is useful is virtuous; also that what is useful is just, and what is just is useful.

**[6:23]** I can say this, for I am speaking, not to merchants who are covetous from a desire to make gain, but to my children.

**[6:24]** And I am speaking of the duties which I wish to impress upon and impart to you, whom I have chosen for the service of the Lord; so that those things which have been already implanted and fixed in your minds and characters by habit and training may now be further unfolded to you by explanation and instruction.

**[6:25]** 26.

**[6:26]** Therefore as I am about to speak of what is useful, I will take up those words of  the Prophet: "Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies and not to covetousness," that the sound of the word "useful" may not rouse in us the desire for money.

**[6:27]** Some indeed put it thus: "Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies and not to what is useful," that is, that kind of usefulness which is always on the watch for making gains in business, and has been bent and diverted by the habits of men to the pursuit of money.

**[6:28]** For as a rule most people call that only useful which is profitable, but we are speaking of that kind of usefulness which is sought in earthly loss "that we may gain Christ," whose gain is "godliness with contentment".

**[6:29]** Great, too, is the gain whereby we attain to godliness, which is rich with God, not indeed in fleeting wealth, but in eternal gifts, and in which rests no uncertain trial but grace constant and unending.

**[6:30]** 27.

**[6:31]** There is therefore a usefulness connected with the body, and also one that has to do with godliness, according to the Apostle's division: "Bodily exercise profiteth a little, but godliness is profitable unto all things".

**[6:32]** And what is so virtuous as integrity? what so seemly as to preserve the body unspotted and undefiled, and its purity unsullied? What, again, is so seemly as that a widow should keep her plighted troth to her dead husband? What more useful than this whereby the heavenly kingdom is attained? For "there are some who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake".

**[7:1]** Chapter VII.

**[7:2]** What is useful is the same as what is virtuous; nothing is more useful than love, which is gained by gentleness, courtesy, kindness, justice, and the other virtues, as we are given to understand from the histories of Moses and David.

**[7:3]** Lastly, confidence springs from love, and again love from confidence.

**[7:4]** 28.

**[7:5]** There is therefore not only a close intercourse between what is virtuous and what is useful, but the same thing is both useful and virtuous.

**[7:6]** Therefore He Who willed to open the kingdom of heaven to all sought not what was useful to Himself, but what was useful for all.

**[7:7]** Thus we must have a certain order and proceed step by step from habitual or common acts to those which are more excellent, so as to show by many examples the advancement of what is useful.

**[7:8]** 29.

**[7:9]** And first we may know there is nothing so useful as to be loved, nothing so useless as not to be loved; for to be hated in my opinion is simply fatal and altogether deadly.

**[7:10]** We speak of this, then, in order that we may take care to give cause for a good estimate and opinion to be formed of us, and may try to get a place in others' affections through our calmness of mind and kindness of soul.

**[7:11]** For goodness is agreeable and pleasing to all, and there is nothing that so easily reaches human feelings.

**[7:12]** And if that is assisted by gentleness of character and willingness, as well as by moderation in giving orders and courtesy of speech, by honour in word, by a ready interchange of conversation and by the grace of modesty, it is incredible how much all this tends to an increase of love.

**[7:13]** 30.

**[7:14]** We read, not only in the case of private individuals but even of kings, what is the effect of ready and willing courtesy, and what harm pride and great swelling words have done, so far as to make even kingdoms to totter and powers to be destroyed.

**[7:15]** If any one gains the people's favour by advice or service, by fulfilling the duties of his ministry or office, or if he encounters danger for the sake of the whole nation, there is no doubt but that such love will be shown him by the people that they all will put his safety and welfare before their own.

**[7:16]** 31.

**[7:17]** What reproaches Moses had to bear from his people! But when the Lord would have avenged him on those who reviled him, he often used to offer himself for the people that he might save them from the divine anger.

**[7:18]** With what gentle words used he to address the people, even after he was wronged! He comforted them in their labours, consoled them by his prophetic declarations of the future, and encouraged them by his works.

**[7:19]** And though he often spoke with God, yet he was wont to address men gently and pleasantly.

**[7:20]** Worthily was he considered to stand above all men.

**[7:21]** For they could not even look on his face, and refused to believe that his sepulchre was found.

**[7:22]** He had captivated the minds of all the people to such an extent; that they loved him even more for his gentleness than they admired him for his deeds.

**[7:23]** 32.

**[7:24]** There is David too who followed his steps, who was chosen from among all to rule the people.

**[7:25]** How gentle and kindly he was, humble in spirit too, how diligent and ready to show affection.

**[7:26]** Before he came to the throne he offered himself in the stead of  all.

**[7:27]** As king he showed himself an equal to all in warfare, and shared in their labours.

**[7:28]** He was brave in battle, gentle in ruling, patient under abuse, and more ready to bear than to return wrongs.

**[7:29]** So dear was he to all, that though a youth, he was chosen even against his will to rule over them, and was made to undertake the duty though he withstood it.

**[7:30]** When old he was asked by his people not to engage in battle, because they all preferred to incur danger for his sake rather than that he should undergo it for theirs.

**[7:31]** 33.

**[7:32]** He had bound the people to himself freely in doing his duty; first, when he during the division among the people preferred to live like an exile at Hebron rather than to reign at Jerusalem; next, when he showed that he loved valour even in an enemy.

**[7:33]** He had also thought that justice should be shown to those who had borne arms against himself the same as to his own men.

**[7:34]** Again, he admired Abner, the bravest champion of the opposing side, whilst he was their leader and was yet waging war.

**[7:35]** Nor did he despise him when suing for peace, but honoured him by a banquet.

**[7:36]** When killed by treachery, he mourned and wept for him.

**[7:37]** He followed him and honoured his obsequies, and evinced his good faith in desiring vengeance for the murder; for he handed on that duty to his son in the charge that he gave him, being anxious rather that the death of an innocent man should not be left unavenged, than that any one should mourn for his own.

**[7:38]** 34.

**[7:39]** It is no small thing, especially in the case of a king, so to perform humble duties as to make oneself like the very lowest.

**[7:40]** It is noble not to seek for food at another's risk and to refuse a drink of water, to confess a sin, and to offer oneself to death for one's people.

**[7:41]** This latter David did, so that the divine anger might be turned against himself, when he offered himself to the destroying angel and said: "Lo I have sinned: I the shepherd have done wickedly, but this flock, what hath it done? Let Thy hand be against me".

**[7:42]** 35.

**[7:43]** What further should I say? He opened not his mouth to those planning deceit, and, as though hearing not, he thought no word should be returned, nor did be answer their reproaches.

**[7:44]** When he was evil spoken of, he prayed, when he was cursed, he blessed.

**[7:45]** He walked in simplicity of heart, and fled from the proud.

**[7:46]** He was a follower of those unspotted from the world, one who mixed ashes with his food when bewailing his sins, and mingled his drink with weeping.

**[7:47]** Worthily, then, was he called for by all the people.

**[7:48]** All the tribes of Israel came to him saying: "Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

**[7:49]** Also yesterday and the day before when Saul lived, and reigned, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel.

**[7:50]** And the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed My people!" And why should I say more about him of whom the word of the Lord has gone forth to say: "I have found David according to My heart"? Who ever walked in holiness of heart and in justice as he did, so as to fulfil the will of God; for whose sake pardon was granted to his children when they sinned, and their rights were preserved to his heirs?  36.

**[7:51]** Who would not have loved him, when they saw how dear he was to his friends? For as he truly loved his friends, so he thought that he was loved as much in return by his own friends.

**[7:52]** Nay, parents put him even before their own children, and children loved him more than their parents.

**[7:53]** Wherefore Saul was very angry and strove to strike Jonathan his son with a spear because he thought that David's friendship held a higher place in his esteem than either filial piety or a father's authority.

**[7:54]** 37.

**[7:55]** It gives a very great impetus to mutual love if one shows love in return to those who love us and proves that one does not love them less than oneself is loved, especially if one shows it by the proofs that a faithful friendship gives.

**[7:56]** What is so likely to win favour as gratitude? What more natural than to love one who loves us? What so implanted and so impressed on men's feelings as the wish to let another, by whom we want to be loved, know that we love him? Well does the wise man say: "Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend".

**[7:57]** And again: "I will not be ashamed to defend a friend, neither will I hide myself from him".

**[7:58]** If, indeed, the words in Ecclesiasticus testify that the medicine of life and immortality is in a friend; yet none has ever doubted that it is in love that our best defence lies.

**[7:59]** As the Apostle says: "It beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things; love never faileth".

**[7:60]** 38.

**[7:61]** Thus David failed not, for he was  dear to all, and wished to be loved rather than feared by his subjects.

**[7:62]** Fear keeps the watch of temporal protection, but knows not how to keep guard permanently.

**[7:63]** And so where fear has departed, boldness often creeps in; for fear does not force confidence but affection calls it forth.

**[7:64]** 39.

**[7:65]** Love, then, is the first thing to give us a recommendation.

**[7:66]** It is a good thing therefore to have our witness in the love of many.

**[7:67]** Then arises confidence, so that even strangers are not afraid to trust themselves to thy kindness, when they see thee so dear to many.

**[7:68]** So likewise one goes through confidence to love, so that he who has shown good faith to one or two has an influence as it were on the minds of all, and wins the good-will of all.

**[8:1]** Chapter VIII.

**[8:2]** Nothing has greater effect in gaining good-will than giving advice; but none can trust it unless it rests on justice and prudence.

**[8:3]** How conspicuous these two virtues were in Solomon is shown by his well-known judgment.

**[8:4]** 40.

**[8:5]** Two things, therefore, love and confidence, are the most efficacious in commending us to others; also this third quality if thou hast it, namely, what many consider to be worthy of admiration in thee, and think to be rightly worthy of honour [the power, in fact, of giving good advice].

**[8:6]** 41.

**[8:7]** Since the giving of good advice is a great means of gaining men's affections, prudence and justice are much needed in every case.

**[8:8]** These are looked for by most, so that confidence at once is placed in him in whom they exist, because he can give useful and trustworthy advice to whoever wants it.

**[8:9]** Who will put himself into the hands of a man whom he does not think to be more wise than himself who asks for advice? It is necessary therefore that he of whom advice is asked should be superior to him who asks it.

**[8:10]** For why should we consult a man when we do not think that he can make anything more plain than we ourselves see it?  42.

**[8:11]** But if we have found a man that by the vigour of his character, by his strength of mind and influence, stands forth above all others, and further, is better fitted by example and experience than others; that can put an end to immediate dangers, foresee future ones, point out those close at hand, can explain a subject, bring relief in time, is ready not only to give advice but also to give help,—in such a man confidence is placed, so that he who seeks advice can say: "Though evil should happen to me through him, I will bear it".

**[8:12]** 43.

**[8:13]** To a man of this sort then we entrust our safety and our reputation, for he is, as we said before, just and prudent.

**[8:14]** Justice causes us to have no fear of deceit, and prudence frees us from having any suspicions of error.

**[8:15]** However, we trust ourselves more readily to a just than to a prudent man, to put it in the way people generally do.

**[8:16]** But, according to the definition of the philosophers, where there is one virtue, others exist too, whilst prudence cannot exist without justice.

**[8:17]** We find this stated also in our writers, for David says: "The just showeth mercy and lendeth".

**[8:18]** What the just lends, he says elsewhere: "A good man is he that showeth mercy and lendeth, he will guide his words with discretion".

**[8:19]** 44.

**[8:20]** Is not that noble judgment of Solomon full of wisdom and justice? Let us see whether it is so.

**[8:21]** "Two women," it says, "stood before King Solomon, and the one said to him, Hear me, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house, and before the third day we gave birth and bore a son apiece, and were together, there was no witness in the house, nor any other woman with us, only we two alone.

**[8:22]** And her son died this night, because she overlaid it, and she arose at midnight, and took my son from my breast, and laid it in her bosom, and her dead child she laid at my breast.

**[8:23]** And I arose in the morning to give my child suck, and found him dead.

**[8:24]** And I considered it at dawn, and behold it was not my son.

**[8:25]** And the other woman said, Nay, but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son".

**[8:26]** 45.

**[8:27]** This was their dispute, in which either tried to claim the living child for herself, and denied that the dead one was hers.

**[8:28]** Then the king commanded a sword to be brought and the infant to be cut in half, and either piece to be given to one, one half to the one, and one half to the other.

**[8:29]** Then the woman whose the child really was, moved by her feelings, cried out: "Divide not the child, my lord; let it rather be given to her and live, and do not kill it".

**[8:30]** But the other answered: "Let it be neither mine nor hers, divide it".

**[8:31]** Then the king ordered that the  infant should be given to the woman who had said: Do not kill it, but give it to that woman; "For," as it says, "her bowels yearned upon her son".

**[8:32]** 46.

**[8:33]** It is not wrong to suppose that the mind of God was in him; for what is hidden from God? What can be more hidden than the witness that lies deep within; into which the mind of the wise king entered as though to judge a mother's feelings, and elicited as it were the voice of a mother's heart.

**[8:34]** For a mother's feelings were laid bare, when she chose that her son should live with another, rather than that he should be killed in his mother's sight.

**[8:35]** 47.

**[8:36]** It was therefore a sign of wisdom to distinguish between secret heart-thoughts, to draw the truth from hidden springs, and to pierce as it were with the sword of the Spirit not only the inward parts of the body, but even of the mind and soul.

**[8:37]** It was the part of justice also that she who had killed her own child should not take away another's, but that the real mother should have her own back again.

**[8:38]** Indeed the Scriptures have declared this.

**[8:39]** "All Israel," it says, "heard of the judgment which the king had judged, and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment".

**[8:40]** Solomon also himself had asked for wisdom, so that a prudent heart might be given him to hear and to judge with justice.

**[9:1]** Chapter IX.

**[9:2]** Though justice and prudence are inseparable, we must have respect to the ideas of people in general, for they make a distinction between the different cardinal virtues.

**[9:3]** 48.

**[9:4]** It is clear also, according to the sacred Scriptures, which are the older, that wisdom cannot exist without justice, for where one of these two is, there the other must be also.

**[9:5]** With what wisdom did Daniel expose the lie in the false accusation brought against him by his thorough examination, so that those false informers had no answer ready to hand! It was a mark of prudence to convict the criminals by the witness of their own words, and a sign of justice to give over the guilty to punishment, and to save the innocent from it.

**[9:6]** 49.

**[9:7]** There is therefore an inseparable union between wisdom and justice; but, generally speaking, the one special form of virtue is divided up.

**[9:8]** Thus temperance lies in despising pleasures, fortitude may be seen in undergoing labours and dangers, prudence in the choice of what is good, by knowing how to distinguish between things useful and the reverse; justice, in being a good guardian of another's rights and protector of its own, thus maintaining for each his own.

**[9:9]** We can make this fourfold division in deference to commonly received ideas; and so, whilst deviating from those subtle discussions of philosophic learning which are brought forth as though from some inner recess for the sake of investigating the truth, can follow the commonly received use and their ordinary meaning.

**[9:10]** Keeping, then, to this division, let us return to our subject.

**[10:1]** Chapter X.

**[10:2]** Men entrust their safety rather to a just than to a prudent man.

**[10:3]** But every one is wont to seek out the man who combines in himself the qualities of justice and prudence.

**[10:4]** Solomon gives us an example of this.

**[10:5]** (The words which the queen of Sheba spoke of him are explained.

**[10:6]** ) Also Daniel and Joseph.

**[10:7]** 50.

**[10:8]** We entrust our case to the most prudent man we can find, and ask advice from him more readily than we do from others.

**[10:9]** However, the faithful counsel of a just man stands first and often has more weight than the great abilities of the wisest of men: "For better are the wounds of a friend than the kisses of others".

**[10:10]** And just because it is the judgment of a just man, it is also the conclusion of a wise one: in the one lies the result of the matter in dispute, in the other readiness of invention.

**[10:11]** 51.

**[10:12]** And if one connects the two, there will be great soundness in the advice given, which is regarded by all with admiration for the wisdom shown, and with love for its justice.

**[10:13]** And so all will desire to hear the wisdom of that man in whom those two virtues are found together, as all the kings of the earth desired to see the face of Solomon and to hear his wisdom.

**[10:14]** Nay, even the queen of Sheba came to him and tried him with questions.

**[10:15]** She came and spoke of all the things that were in her heart, and heard all the wisdom of Solomon, nor did any word escape her.

**[10:16]** 52.

**[10:17]** Who she was whom nothing escaped, and that there was nothing which the truth-loving Solomon did not tell her, learn, O man, from this which thou hearest her saying: "It was a true report that I heard in  mine own land of thy words and of thy prudence, yet I did not believe those that told it me until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and behold the half was not told me.

**[10:18]** Thou hast added good things over and above all that I heard in mine own land.

**[10:19]** Blessed are thy women and blessed thy servants, which stand before thee, and that hear all thy prudence".

**[10:20]** Recognize the feast of the true Solomon, and who are set down at that feast; recognize it wisely and think in what land all the nations shall hear the fame of true wisdom and justice, and with what eyes they shall see Him, beholding those things which are not seen.

**[10:21]** "For the things that are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal".

**[10:22]** 53.

**[10:23]** What women are blessed but those of whom it is said "that many hear the word of God and bring forth fruit"? And again: "Whosoever doeth the word of God is My father and sister and mother".

**[10:24]** And who are those blessed servants, who stand before Him, but Paul, who said: "Even to this day I stand witnessing both to great and small;" or Simeon, who was waiting in the temple to see the consolation of Israel? How could he have asked to be let depart, except that in standing before the Lord he had not the power of departing, but only according to the will of God? Solomon is put before us simply for the sake of example, of whom it was eagerly expected that his wisdom should be heard.

**[10:25]** 54.

**[10:26]** Joseph also when in prison was not free from being consulted about matters of uncertainty.

**[10:27]** His counsel was of advantage to the whole of Egypt, so that it felt not the seven years' famine, and he was able even to relieve other peoples from their dreadful hunger.

**[10:28]** 55.

**[10:29]** Daniel, though one of the captives, was made the head of the royal counsellors.

**[10:30]** By his counsels he improved the present and foretold the future.

**[10:31]** Confidence was put in him in all things, because he had frequently interpreted things, and had shown that he had declared the truth.

**[11:1]** Chapter XI.

**[11:2]** A third element which tends to gain any one's confidence is shown to have been conspicuous in Moses, Daniel, and Joseph.

**[11:3]** 56.

**[11:4]** But a third point seems also to have been noted in the case of those who were thought worthy of admiration after the example of Joseph, Solomon, and Daniel.

**[11:5]** For what shall I say of Moses whose advice all Israel always waited for, whose life caused them to trust in his prudence and increased their esteem for him? Who would not trust to the counsel of Moses, to whom the elders reserved for decision whatever they thought beyond their understanding and powers?  57.

**[11:6]** Who would refuse the counsel of Daniel, of whom God Himself said: "Who is wiser than Daniel?" How can men doubt about the minds of those to whom God has given such grace? By the counsel of Moses wars were brought to an end, and for his merit's sake food came from heaven and drink from the rock.

**[11:7]** 58.

**[11:8]** How pure must have been the soul of Daniel to soften the character of barbarians and to tame the lions! What temperance was his, what self-restraint in soul and body! Not unworthily did he become an object of admiration to all, when—and all men do admire this,—though enjoying royal friendships, he sought not for gold, nor counted the honour given him as more precious than his faith.

**[11:9]** For he was willing to endure danger for the law of God rather than to be turned from his purpose in order to gain the favour of men.

**[11:10]** 59.

**[11:11]** And what, again, shall I say of the chastity and justice of Joseph, whom I had almost passed by, whereby on the one hand he rejected the allurements of his mistress and refused rewards, on the other he mocked at death, repressed his fear, and chose a prison? Who would not consider him a fit person to give advice in a private case, whose fruitful spirit and fertile mind enriched the barrenness of the time with the wealth of his counsels and heart?.

**[12:1]** Chapter XII.

**[12:2]** No one asks counsel from a man tainted with vice, or from one who is morose or impracticable, but rather from one of whom we have a pattern in the Scriptures.

**[12:3]** 60.

**[12:4]** We note therefore that in seeking for counsel, uprightness of life, excellence in virtues, habits of benevolence, and the charm of good-nature have very great weight.

**[12:5]** Who seeks for a spring in the mud? Who wants to drink from muddy water? So  where there is luxurious living, excess, and a union of vices, who will think that he ought to draw from that source? Who does not despise a foul life? Who will think a man to be useful to another's cause whom he sees to be useless in his own life? Who, again, does not avoid a wicked, ill-disposed, abusive person, who is always ready to do harm? Who would not be only too eager to avoid him?  61.

**[12:6]** And who will come to a man however well fitted to give the best of advice who is nevertheless hard to approach? It goes with him as with a fountain whose waters are shut off.

**[12:7]** What is the advantage of having wisdom, if one refuses to give advice? If one cuts off the opportunities of giving advice, the source is closed, so as no longer to flow for others or to be of any good to oneself.

**[12:8]** 62.

**[12:9]** Well can we refer this to him who, possessing prudence, has defiled it with the foulness of a vicious life and so pollutes the water at the source.

**[12:10]** His life is a proof of a degenerate spirit.

**[12:11]** How can one judge him to be good in counsel whom one sees to be evil in character? He ought to be superior to me, if I am ready to trust myself to him.

**[12:12]** Am I to suppose that he is fit to give me advice who never takes it for himself, or am I to believe that he has time to give to me when he has none for himself, when his mind is filled with pleasures, and he is overcome by lust, is the slave of avarice, is excited by greed, and is terrified with fright? How is there room for counsel here where there is none for quiet?  63.

**[12:13]** That man of counsel whom I must admire and look up to, whom the gracious Lord gave to our fathers, put aside all that was offensive.

**[12:14]** His follower he ought to be, who can give counsel and protect another's prudence from vice; for nothing foul can mingle with that.

**[13:1]** Chapter XIII.

**[13:2]** The beauty of wisdom is made plain by the divine testimony.

**[13:3]** From this he goes on to prove its connection with the other virtues.

**[13:4]** 64.

**[13:5]** Is there any one who would like to be beautiful in face and at the same time to have its charm spoilt by a beast-like body and fearful talons? Now the form of virtues is so wonderful and glorious, and especially the beauty of wisdom, as the whole of the Scriptures tell us.

**[13:6]** For it is more brilliant than the sun, and when compared with the stars far outshines any constellation.

**[13:7]** Night takes their light away in its train, but wickedness cannot overcome wisdom.

**[13:8]** 65.

**[13:9]** We have spoken of its beauty, and proved it by the witness of Scripture.

**[13:10]** It remains to show on the authority of Scripture that there can be no fellowship between it and vice, but that it has an inseparable union with the rest of the virtues.

**[13:11]** "It has a spirit sagacious, undefiled, sure, holy, loving what is good, quick, that never forbids a kindness, kind, steadfast, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things".

**[13:12]** And again: "She teacheth temperance and justice and virtue".

**[14:1]** Chapter XIV.

**[14:2]** Prudence is combined with all the virtues, especially with contempt of riches.

**[14:3]** 66.

**[14:4]** Prudence, therefore, works through all things, she has fellowship with all that is good.

**[14:5]** For how can she give good advice unless she have justice too, so that she may clothe herself in consistency, not fear death, be held back by no alarm, no fear, nor think it right to be turned aside from the truth by any flattery, nor shun exile, knowing that the world is the fatherland of the wise man.

**[14:6]** She fears not want, for she knows that nothing is wanting to the wise man, since the whole world of riches is his.

**[14:7]** What is greater than the man that knows not how to be excited at the thought of money, and has a contempt for riches, and looks down as from some lofty vantage-ground on the desires of men? Men think that one who acts thus is more than man: "Who is this," it says, "and we will praise him.

**[14:8]** For wonderful things hath he done in his life".

**[14:9]** Surely he ought to be admired who despises riches, seeing that most place them even before their own safety.

**[14:10]** 67.

**[14:11]** The rule of economy and the authority of self-restraint befits all, and most of all him who stands highest in honour; so that no love for his treasures may seize upon such a man, and that he who rules over free men may never become a slave to money.

**[14:12]** It is more seemly that in soul he should be superior to treasures, and in willing service be subject to his friends.

**[14:13]** For humility increases the regard in which one is held.

**[14:14]** It is praiseworthy and right for the chief of men to have no desire for filthy lucre in common with Syrian traders and Gilead merchants, nor to place all their hope of good in money, or to count up their daily gains and to calculate their savings like a hireling.

**[15:1]** Chapter XV.

**[15:2]** Of liberality.

**[15:3]** To whom it must chiefly be shown, and how men of slender means may show it by giving their service and counsel.

**[15:4]** 68.

**[15:5]** But if it is praiseworthy to have one's soul free from this failing, how much more glorious is it to gain the love of the people by liberality which is neither too freely shown to those who are unsuitable, nor too sparingly bestowed upon the needy.

**[15:6]** 69.

**[15:7]** There are many kinds of liberality.

**[15:8]** Not only can we distribute and give away food to those who need it from our own daily supply, so that they may sustain life; but we can also give advice and help to those who are ashamed to show their want openly, so long as the common supplies of the needy are not exhausted.

**[15:9]** I am now speaking of one set over some office.

**[15:10]** If he is a priest or almoner, let him inform the bishop of them, and not withhold the name of any he knows to be in any need, or to have lost their wealth and to be now reduced to want; especially if they have not fallen into this trouble owing to wastefulness in youth, but because of another's theft, or through loss of their inheritance from no fault of their own, so that they cannot now earn their daily bread.

**[15:11]** 70.

**[15:12]** The highest kind of liberality is, to redeem captives, to save them from the hands of their enemies, to snatch men from death, and, most of all, women from shame, to restore children to their parents, parents to their children, and, to give back a citizen to his country.

**[15:13]** This was recognized when Thrace and Illyria were so terribly devastated.

**[15:14]** How many captives were then for sale all over the world! Could one but call them together, their number would have surpassed that of a whole province.

**[15:15]** Yet there were some who would have sent back into slavery those whom the Church had redeemed.

**[15:16]** They themselves were harder than slavery itself to look askance at another's mercy.

**[15:17]** If they themselves (they said) had come to slavery, they would be slaves freely.

**[15:18]** If they had been sold, they would not refuse the service of slavery.

**[15:19]** They wished to undo the freedom of others, though they could not undo their own slavery, unless perchance it should please the buyer to receive his price again, whereby, however, slavery would not be simply undone but redeemed.

**[15:20]** 71.

**[15:21]** It is then a special quality of liberality to redeem captives, especially from barbarian enemies who are moved by no spark of human feeling to show mercy, except so far as avarice has preserved it with a view to redemption.

**[15:22]** It is also a great thing to take upon oneself another's debt, if the debtor cannot pay and is hard pressed to do so, and where the money is due by right and is only left unpaid through want.

**[15:23]** So, too, it is a sign of great liberality to bring up children, and to take care of orphans.

**[15:24]** 72.

**[15:25]** There are others who place in marriage maidens that have lost their parents, so as to preserve their chastity, and who help them not only with good wishes but also by a sum of money.

**[15:26]** There is also another kind of liberality which the Apostle teaches: "If any that believeth hath widows let him relieve them, that the Church be not burdened by supplying them, that it may have enough for those that are widows indeed".

**[15:27]** 73.

**[15:28]** Useful, then, is liberality of this sort; but it is not common to all.

**[15:29]** For there are many good men who have but slender means, and are content with little for their own use, and are not able to give help to lighten the poverty of others.

**[15:30]** However, another sort of kindness is ready to their hand, whereby they can help those poorer still.

**[15:31]** For there is a twofold liberality: one that gives actual assistance, that is, in money; the other, which is busy in offering active help, is often much grander and nobler.

**[15:32]** 74.

**[15:33]** How much grander it was for Abraham to have recovered his captured son-in-law by his victorious arms, than if he had ransomed him! How much more usefully did holy Joseph help King Pharaoh by his counsel to provide for the future, than if he had offered him money! For money would not have bought back the fruitfulness of any  one state; whilst he by his foresight kept the famine for five years from the whole of Egypt.

**[15:34]** 75.

**[15:35]** Money is easily spent; counsels can never be exhausted.

**[15:36]** They only grow the stronger by constant use.

**[15:37]** Money grows less and quickly comes to an end, and has failed even kindness itself; so that the more there are to whom one wants to give, the fewer one can help; and often one has not got what one thinks ought to be given to others.

**[15:38]** But as regards the offer of advice and active help, the more there are to spend it on, the more there seems to be, and the more it returns to its own source.

**[15:39]** The rich stream of prudence ever flows back upon itself, and the more it has reached out to, so much the more active becomes all that remains.

**[16:1]** Chapter XVI.

**[16:2]** Due measure must be observed in liberality, that it may not be expended on worthless persons, when it is needed by worthier ones.

**[16:3]** However, alms are not to be given in too sparing and hesitating a way.

**[16:4]** One ought rather to follow the example of the blessed Joseph, whose prudence is commended at great length.

**[16:5]** 76.

**[16:6]** It is clear, then, that there ought to be due measure in our liberality, that our gifts may not become useless.

**[16:7]** Moderation must be observed, especially by priests, for fear that they should give away for the sake of ostentation, and not for justice' sake.

**[16:8]** Never was the greed of beggars greater than it is now.

**[16:9]** They come in full vigour, they come with no reason but that they are on the tramp.

**[16:10]** They want to empty the purses of the poor—to deprive them of their means of support.

**[16:11]** Not content with a little, they ask for more.

**[16:12]** In the clothes that cover them they seek a ground to urge their demands, and with lies about their lives they ask for further sums of money.

**[16:13]** If any one were to trust their tale too readily, he would quickly drain the fund which is meant to serve for the sustenance of the poor.

**[16:14]** Let there be method in our giving, so that the poor may not go away empty nor the subsistence of the needy be done away and become the spoil of the dishonest.

**[16:15]** Let there be then such due measure that kindness may never be put aside, and true need never be left neglected.

**[16:16]** 77.

**[16:17]** Many pretend they have debts.

**[16:18]** Let the truth be looked into.

**[16:19]** They bemoan the fact that they have been stripped of everything by robbers.

**[16:20]** In such a case give credit only if the misfortune is apparent, or the person is well known; and then readily give help.

**[16:21]** To those rejected by the Church supplies must be granted if they are in want of food.

**[16:22]** He, then, that observes method in his giving is hard towards none, but is free towards all.

**[16:23]** We ought not only to lend our ears to hear the voices of those who plead, but also our eyes to look into their needs.

**[16:24]** Weakness calls more loudly to the good dispenser than the voice of the poor.

**[16:25]** It cannot always be that the cries of an importunate beggar will never extort more, but let us not always give way to impudence.

**[16:26]** He must be seen who does not see thee.

**[16:27]** He must be sought for who is ashamed to be seen.

**[16:28]** He also that is in prison must come to thy thoughts; another seized with sickness must present himself to thy mind, as he cannot reach thy ears.

**[16:29]** 78.

**[16:30]** The more people see thy zeal in showing mercy, the more will they love thee.

**[16:31]** I know many priests who had the more, the more they gave.

**[16:32]** For they who see a good dispenser give him something to distribute in his round of duty, sure that the act of mercy will reach the poor.

**[16:33]** If they see him giving away either in excess or too sparingly, they contemn either of these; in the one case because he wastes the fruits of another's labours by unnecessary payments, on the other hand because he hoards them in his money bags.

**[16:34]** As, then, method must be observed in liberality, so also at times it seems as though the spur must be applied.

**[16:35]** Method, then, so that the kindness one shows may be able to be shown day by day, and that we may not have to withdraw from a needful case what we have freely spent on waste.

**[16:36]** A spur, because money is better laid out in food for the poor than on a purse for the rich.

**[16:37]** We must take care lest in our money chests we shut up the welfare of the needy, and bury the life of the poor as it were in a sepulchre.

**[16:38]** 79.

**[16:39]** Joseph could have given away all the wealth of Egypt, and have spent the royal treasures; but he would not even seem to be wasteful of what was another's.

**[16:40]** He preferred to sell the corn rather than to give it to the hungry.

**[16:41]** For if he had given it to a few there would have been none for most.

**[16:42]** He gave good proof of that liberality whereby there was enough for all.

**[16:43]** He opened the storehouses that all might buy their corn supply, lest if they received it for nothing, they should give up cultivating the  ground.

**[16:44]** For he who has the use of what is another's often neglects his own.

**[16:45]** 80.

**[16:46]** First of all, then, he gathered up their money, then their implements, last of all he acquired for the king all their rights to the ground.

**[16:47]** He did not wish to deprive all of them of their property, but to support them in it.

**[16:48]** He also imposed a general tax, that they might hold their own in safety.

**[16:49]** So pleasing was this to all from whom he had taken the land, that they looked on it, not as the selling of their rights, but as the recovery of their welfare.

**[16:50]** Thus they spoke: "Thou hast saved our lives, let us find grace in the sight of our Lord".

**[16:51]** For they had lost nothing of their own, but had received a new right.

**[16:52]** Nothing of what was useful to them had failed, for they had now gained it in perpetuity.

**[16:53]** 81.

**[16:54]** O noble man! who sought not for the fleeting glory of a needless bounty, but set up as his memorial the lasting benefits of his foresight.

**[16:55]** He acted so that the people should help themselves by their payments, and should not in their time of need seek help from others.

**[16:56]** For it was surely better to give up part of their crops than to lose the whole of their rights.

**[16:57]** He fixed the impost at a fifth of their whole produce, and thus showed himself clear-sighted in making provision for the future, and liberal in the tax he laid upon them.

**[16:58]** Never after did Egypt suffer from such a famine.

**[16:59]** 82.

**[16:60]** How splendidly he inferred the future.

**[16:61]** First, how acutely, when interpreting the royal dream, he stated the truth.

**[16:62]** This was the king's first dream.

**[16:63]** Seven heifers came up out of the river well-favoured and fat-fleshed, and they fed at the banks of the river.

**[16:64]** And other bullocks ill-favoured and lean-fleshed came up out of the river after the heifers, and fed near them on the very edge of the river.

**[16:65]** And these thin and wretched bullocks seemed to devour those others which were so fat and well-favoured.

**[16:66]** And this was the second dream.

**[16:67]** Seven fat ears full and good came up from the ground.

**[16:68]** And after them seven wretched ears, blasted with the wind and withered, endeavoured to take their place.

**[16:69]** And it seemed that the barren and thin ears devoured the rich and fruitful ears.

**[16:70]** 83.

**[16:71]** This dream Joseph unfolded as follows: that the seven heifers were seven years, and the seven ears likewise were seven years,—interpreting the times by the produce of cattle and crops.

**[16:72]** For both the calving of a heifer takes a year, and the produce of a crop fills out a whole year.

**[16:73]** And they came up out of the river just as days, years, and times pass by and flow along swiftly like the rivers.

**[16:74]** He therefore states that the seven earlier years of a rich land will be fertile and fruitful but the latter seven years will be barren and unfruitful, whose barrenness will eat up the richness of the former time.

**[16:75]** Wherefore he warns them to see that supplies of corn are got together in the fruitful years that they may help out the needs of the coming scarcity.

**[16:76]** 84.

**[16:77]** What shall we admire first? His powers of mind, with which he descended to the very resting-place of truth? Or his counsel, whereby he foresaw so great and lasting a need? Or his watchfulness or justice? By his watchfulness, when so high an office was given him, he gathered together such vast supplies; and through his justice he treated all alike.

**[16:78]** And what am I to say of his greatness of mind? For though sold by his brothers into slavery, he took no revenge for this wrong, but put an end to their want.

**[16:79]** What of his gentleness, whereby by a pious fraud he sought to gain the presence of his beloved brother whom, under pretence of a well-planned theft, he declared to have stolen his property, that he might hold him as a hostage of his love?  85.

**[16:80]** Whence it was deservedly said to him by his father: "My son Joseph is enlarged, my son is enlarged, my younger son, my beloved.

**[16:81]** My God hath helped thee and blessed thee with the blessing of heaven above and the blessing of the earth, the earth that hath all things, on account of the blessings of thy father and thy mother.

**[16:82]** It hath prevailed over the blessings of the everlasting hills and the desires of the eternal hills".

**[16:83]** And in Deuteronomy: "Thou Who wast seen in the bush, that Thou mayest come upon the head of Joseph, upon his pate.

**[16:84]** Honoured among his brethren, his glory is as the firstling of his bullocks; his horns are like the horns of unicorns.

**[16:85]** With his horn he shall push the nations even to the ends of the earth.

**[16:86]** They are the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh".

**[17:1]** Chapter XVII.

**[17:2]** What virtues ought to exist in him whom we consult.

**[17:3]** How Joseph and Paul were equipped with them.

**[17:4]** 86.

**[17:5]** Such, then, ought he to be who gives counsel to another, in order that he may offer himself as a pattern in all good works, in teaching, in trueness of character, in seriousness.

**[17:6]** Thus his words will be wholesome and irreproachable, his counsel useful, his life virtuous, and his opinions seemly.

**[17:7]** 87.

**[17:8]** Such was Paul, who gave counsel to virgins, guidance to priests, so as to offer himself as a pattern for us to copy.

**[17:9]** Thus he knew how to be humble, as also Joseph did, who, though sprung from the noble family of the patriarchs, was not ashamed of his base slavery; rather he adorned it with his ready service, and made it glorious by his virtues.

**[17:10]** He knew how to be humble who had to go through the hands of both buyer and seller, and called them, Lord.

**[17:11]** Hear him as he humbles himself: "My lord on my account knoweth not what is in his house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand, neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife; how, then, can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" Full of humility are his words, full, too, of chastity.

**[17:12]** Of humility, for he was obedient to his Lord; of an honourable spirit, for he was grateful; full, also, of chastity, for he thought it a terrible sin to be defiled by so great a crime.

**[17:13]** 88.

**[17:14]** Such, then, ought the man of counsel to be.

**[17:15]** He must have nothing dark, or deceptive, or false about him, to cast a shadow on his life and character, nothing wicked or evil to keep back those who want advice.

**[17:16]** For there are some things which one flies from, others which one despises.

**[17:17]** We fly from those things which can do harm, or can perfidiously and quietly grow to do us hurt, as when he whose advice we ask is of doubtful honour, or is desirous of money, so that a certain sum can make him change his mind.

**[17:18]** If a man acts unjustly, we fly from him and avoid him.

**[17:19]** A man that is a pleasure seeker and extravagant, although he does not act falsely, yet is avaricious and too fond of filthy lucre; such an one is despised.

**[17:20]** What proof of hard work, what fruits of labour, can he give who gives himself up to a sluggish and idle life, or what cares and anxieties ever enter his mind?  89.

**[17:21]** Therefore the man of good counsel says: "I have learnt in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content".

**[17:22]** For he knew that the root of all evils is the love of money, and therefore he was content with what he had, without seeking for what was another's.

**[17:23]** Sufficient for me, he says, is what I have; whether I have little or much, to me it is much.

**[17:24]** It seems as though he wanted to state it as clearly as possible.

**[17:25]** He makes use of these words: "I am content," he says, "with what I have".

**[17:26]** That means: "I neither have want, nor have I too much.

**[17:27]** I have no want, for I seek nothing more.

**[17:28]** I have not too much, for I have it not for myself, but for the many".

**[17:29]** This is said with reference to money.

**[17:30]** 90.

**[17:31]** But he could have said these words about everything, for all that he had at the moment contented him; that is, he wanted no greater honour, he sought for no further services, he was not desirous of vainglory, nor did he look for gratitude where it was not due; but patient in labours, sure in his merits, he waited for the end of the struggle that he must needs endure.

**[17:32]** "I know," he says, "how to be abased".

**[17:33]** An untaught humility has no claim to praise, but only that which possesses modesty and a knowledge of self.

**[17:34]** For there is a humility that rests on fear, one, too, that rests on want of skill and ignorance.

**[17:35]** Therefore the Scripture says: "He will save the humble in spirit".

**[17:36]** Gloriously, therefore, does he say: "I know how to be abased;" that is to say, where, in what moderation, to what end, in what duty, in which office.

**[17:37]** The Pharisee knew not how to be abased, therefore he was cast down.

**[17:38]** The publican knew, and therefore he was justified.

**[17:39]** 91.

**[17:40]** Paul knew, too, how to abound, for he had a rich soul, though he possessed not the treasure of a rich man.

**[17:41]** He knew how to abound, for he sought no gift in money, but looked for fruit in grace.

**[17:42]** We can understand his words that he knew how to abound also in another way.

**[17:43]** For he could say again: "O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged".

**[17:44]** 92.

**[17:45]** In all things he was accustomed both to be full and to be hungry.

**[17:46]** Blessed is he that knows how to be full in Christ.

**[17:47]** Not corporal, but spiritual, is that satiety which knowledge brings about.

**[17:48]** And rightly is  there need of knowledge: "For man lives not by bread alone, but by every word of God".

**[17:49]** For he who knew how to be full also knew how to be hungry, so as to be always seeking something new, hungering after God, thirsting for the Lord.

**[17:50]** He knew how to hunger, for he knew that the hungry shall eat.

**[17:51]** He knew, also, how to abound, and was able to abound, for he had nothing and yet possessed all things.

**[18:1]** Chapter XVIII.

**[18:2]** We learn from the fact of the separation of the ten tribes from King Rehoboam what harm bad counsellors can do.

**[18:3]** 93.

**[18:4]** Justice, then, especially graces men that are set over any office; on the other hand, injustice fails them and fights against them.

**[18:5]** Scripture itself gives us an example, where it says, that when the people of Israel, after the death of Solomon, had asked his son Rehoboam to free their neck from their cruel yoke, and to lighten the harshness of his father's rule, he, despising the counsel of the old men, gave the following answer at the suggestion of the young men: "He would add a burden to the yoke of his father, and change their lighter toils for harder".

**[18:6]** 94.

**[18:7]** Angered by this answer, the people said: "We have no portion in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse.

**[18:8]** Return to your tents, O Israel.

**[18:9]** For we will not have this man for a prince or a leader over us".

**[18:10]** So, forsaken and deserted by the people, he could keep with him scarce two of the ten tribes for David's sake.

**[19:1]** Chapter XIX.

**[19:2]** Many are won by justice and benevolence and courtesy, but all this must be sincere.

**[19:3]** 95.

**[19:4]** It is plain, then, that equity strengthens empires, and injustice destroys them.

**[19:5]** How could wickedness hold fast a kingdom when it cannot even rule over a single family? There is need, therefore, of the greatest kindness, so that we may preserve not only the government of affairs in general, but also the rights of individuals.

**[19:6]** Benevolence is of the greatest value; for it seeks to embrace all in its favours, to bind them to itself by fulfilling duties, and to pledge them to itself by its charm.

**[19:7]** 96.

**[19:8]** We have also said that courtesy of speech has great effect in winning favour.

**[19:9]** But we want it to be sincere and sensible, without flattery, lest flattery should disgrace the simplicity and purity of our address.

**[19:10]** We ought to be a pattern to others not only in act but also in word, in purity, and in faith.

**[19:11]** What we wish to be thought, such let us be; and let us show openly such feelings as we have within us.

**[19:12]** Let us not say an unjust word in our heart that we think can be hid in silence, for He hears things said in secret Who made things secret, and knows the secrets of the heart, and has implanted feelings within.

**[19:13]** Therefore as though under the eyes of the Judge let us consider all we do as set forth in the light, that it may be manifest to all.

**[20:1]** Chapter XX.

**[20:2]** Familiarity with good men is very advantageous to all, especially to the young, as is shown by the example of Joshua and Moses and others.

**[20:3]** Further, those who are unlike in age are often alike in virtues, as Peter and John prove.

**[20:4]** 97.

**[20:5]** It is a very good thing to unite oneself to a good man.

**[20:6]** It is also very useful for the young to follow the guidance of great and wise men.

**[20:7]** For he who lives in company with wise men is wise himself; but he who clings to the foolish is looked on as a fool too.

**[20:8]** This friendship with the wise is a great help in teaching us, and also as giving a sure proof of our uprightness.

**[20:9]** Young men show very soon that they imitate those to whom they attach themselves.

**[20:10]** And this idea gains ground from the fact that in all their daily life they grow to be like those with whom they have enjoyed intercourse to the full.

**[20:11]** 98.

**[20:12]** Joshua the son of Nun became so great, because his union with Moses was the means not only of instructing him in a knowledge of the law, but also of sanctifying him to receive grace.

**[20:13]** When in His tabernacle the majesty of the Lord was seen to shine forth in its divine Presence, Joshua alone was in the tabernacle.

**[20:14]** When Moses spoke with God, Joshua too was covered by the sacred cloud.

**[20:15]** The priests and people stood below, and Joshua and Moses went up the mount to receive the law.

**[20:16]** All the people were within the camp;  Joshua was without the camp in the tabernacle of witness.

**[20:17]** When the pillar of a cloud came down, and God spoke with Moses, he stood as a trusty servant beside him; and he, a young man, did not go out of the tabernacle, though the old men who stood afar off trembled at these divine wonders.

**[20:18]** 99.

**[20:19]** Everywhere, therefore, he alone kept close to holy Moses amid all these wondrous works and dread secrets.

**[20:20]** Wherefore it happens that he who had been his companion in this intercourse with God succeeded to his power.

**[20:21]** Worthy surely was he to stand forth as a man who might stay the course of the river, and who might say: "Sun, stand still," and delay the night and lengthen the day, as though to witness his victory.

**[20:22]** Why?—a blessing denied to Moses—he alone was chosen to lead the people into the promised land.

**[20:23]** A man he was, great in the wonders he wrought by faith, great in his triumphs.

**[20:24]** The works of Moses were of a higher type, his brought greater success.

**[20:25]** Either of these then aided by divine grace rose above all human standing.

**[20:26]** The one ruled the sea, the other heaven.

**[20:27]** 100.

**[20:28]** Beautiful, therefore, is the union between old and young.

**[20:29]** The one to give witness, the other to give comfort; the one to give guidance, the other to give pleasure.

**[20:30]** I pass by Lot, who when young clung to Abraham, as he was setting out.

**[20:31]** For some perhaps might say this arose rather owing to their relationship than from any voluntary action on his part.

**[20:32]** And what are we to say of Elijah and Elisha? Though Scripture has not in so many words stated that Elisha was a young man, yet we gather from it that he was the younger.

**[20:33]** In the Acts of the Apostles, Barnabas took Mark with him, and Paul took Silas and Timothy and Titus.

**[20:34]** 101.

**[20:35]** We see also that duties were divided amongst them according to their superiority in anything.

**[20:36]** The elders took the lead in giving counsel, the younger in showing activity.

**[20:37]** Often, too, those who were alike in virtue but unlike in years were greatly rejoiced at their union, as Peter and John were.

**[20:38]** We read in the Gospel that John was a young man, even in his own words, though he was behind none of the elders in merits and wisdom.

**[20:39]** For in him there was a venerable ripeness of character and the prudence of the hoarhead.

**[20:40]** An unspotted life is the due of a good old age.

**[21:1]** Chapter XXI.

**[21:2]** To defend the weak, or to help strangers, or to perform similar duties, greatly adds to one's worth, especially in the case of tried men.

**[21:3]** Whilst one gets great blame for love of money; wastefulness, also, in the case of priests is very much condemned.

**[21:4]** 102.

**[21:5]** The regard in which one is held is also very much enhanced when one rescues a poor man out of the hands of a powerful one, or saves a condemned criminal from death; so long as it can be done without disturbance, for fear that we might seem to be doing it rather for the sake of showing off than for pity's sake, and so might inflict severer wounds whilst desiring to heal slighter ones.

**[21:6]** But if one has freed a man who is crushed down by the resources and faction of a powerful person, rather than overwhelmed by the deserts of his own wickedness, then the witness of a great and high opinion grows strong.

**[21:7]** 103.

**[21:8]** Hospitality also serves to recommend many.

**[21:9]** For it is a kind of open display of kindly feelings: so that the stranger may not want hospitality, but be courteously received, and that the door may be open to him when he comes.

**[21:10]** It is most seemly in the eyes of the whole world that the stranger should be received with honour; that the charm of hospitality should not fail at our table; that we should meet a guest with ready and free service, and look out for his arrival.

**[21:11]** 104.

**[21:12]** This especially was Abraham's praise, for he watched at the door of his tent, that no stranger by any chance might pass by.

**[21:13]** He carefully kept a lookout, so as to meet the stranger, and anticipate him, and ask him not to pass by, saying: "My lord, if I have found favour in thy sight, pass not by thy servant".

**[21:14]** Therefore as a reward for his hospitality, he received the gift of posterity.

**[21:15]** 105.

**[21:16]** Lot also, his nephew, who was near to him not only in relationship but also in virtue, on account of his readiness to show hospitality, turned aside the punishment of Sodom from himself and his family.

**[21:17]** 106.

**[21:18]** A man ought therefore to be hospitable, kind, upright, not desirous of what belongs to another, willing to give up some  of his own rights if assailed, rather than to take away another's.

**[21:19]** He ought to avoid disputes, to hate quarrels.

**[21:20]** He ought to restore unity and the grace of quietness.

**[21:21]** When a good man gives up any of his own rights, it is not only a sign of liberality, but is also accompanied by great advantages.

**[21:22]** To start with, it is no small gain to be free from the cost of a lawsuit.

**[21:23]** Then it also brings in good results, by an increase of friendship, from which many advantages rise.

**[21:24]** These become afterwards most useful to the man that can despise a little something at the time.

**[21:25]** 107.

**[21:26]** In all the duties of hospitality kindly feeling must be shown to all, but greater respect must be given to the upright.

**[21:27]** For "Whosoever receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward," as the Lord has said.

**[21:28]** Such is the favour in which hospitality stands with God, that not even the draught of cold water shall fail of getting a reward.

**[21:29]** Thou seest that Abraham, in looking for guests, received God Himself to entertain.

**[21:30]** Thou seest that Lot received the angels.

**[21:31]** And how dost thou know that when thou receivest men, thou dost not receive Christ? Christ may be in the stranger that comes, for Christ is there in the person of the poor, as He Himself says: "I was in prison and thou camest to Me, I was naked and thou didst clothe Me".

**[21:32]** 108.

**[21:33]** It is sweet, then, to seek not for money but for grace.

**[21:34]** It is true that this evil has long ago entered into human hearts, so that money stands in the place of honour, and the minds of men are filled with admiration for wealth.

**[21:35]** Thus love of money sinks in and as it were dries up every kindly duty; so that men consider everything a loss which is spent beyond the usual amount.

**[21:36]** But even here the holy Scriptures have been on the watch against love of money, that it might prove no cause of hindrance, saying: "Better is hospitality, even though it consisteth only of herbs".

**[21:37]** And again: "Better is bread in pleasantness with peace".

**[21:38]** For the Scriptures teach us not to be wasteful, but liberal.

**[21:39]** 109.

**[21:40]** There are two kinds of free-giving, one arising from liberality, the other from wasteful extravagance.

**[21:41]** It is a mark of liberality to receive the stranger, to clothe the naked, to redeem the captives, to help the needy.

**[21:42]** It is wasteful to spend money on expensive banquets and much wine.

**[21:43]** Wherefore one reads: "Wine is wasteful, drunkenness is abusive".

**[21:44]** It is wasteful to spend one's own wealth merely for the sake of gaining the favour of the people.

**[21:45]** This they do who spend their inheritance on the games of the circus, or on theatrical pieces and gladiatorial shows, or even a combat of wild beasts, just to surpass the fame of their forefathers for these things.

**[21:46]** All this that they do is but foolish, for it is not right to be extravagant in spending money even on good works.

**[21:47]** 110.

**[21:48]** It is a right kind of liberality to keep due measure towards the poor themselves, that one may have enough for more; and not to go beyond the right limit for the sake of winning favour.

**[21:49]** Whatever comes forth out of a pure sincere disposition, that is seemly.

**[21:50]** It is also seemly not to enter on unnecessary undertakings, nor to omit those that are needed.

**[21:51]** 111.

**[21:52]** But it befits the priest especially to adorn the temple of God with fitting splendour, so that the court of the Lord may be made glorious by his endeavours.

**[21:53]** He ought always to spend money as mercy demands.

**[21:54]** It behoves him to give to strangers what is right.

**[21:55]** This must not be too much, but enough; not more than, but as much as, kindly feeling demands, so that he may never seek another's favour at the expense of the poor, nor show himself as either too stingy or too free to the clergy.

**[21:56]** The one act is unkind, the other wasteful.

**[21:57]** It is unkind if money should be wanting for the necessities of those whom one ought to win back from their wretched employments.

**[21:58]** It is wasteful if there should be too much over for pleasure.

**[22:1]** Chapter XXII.

**[22:2]** We must observe a right standard between too great mildness and excessive harshness.

**[22:3]** They who endeavour to creep into the hearts of others by a false show of mildness gain nothing substantial or lasting.

**[22:4]** This the example of Absalom plainly enough shows.

**[22:5]** 112.

**[22:6]** Moreover, due measure befits even our words and instructions, that it may not seem as though there was either too great mildness or too much harshness.

**[22:7]** Many prefer to be too mild, so as to appear to be good.

**[22:8]** But it is certain that nothing feigned or false can bear the form of true virtue; nay, it cannot even last.

**[22:9]** At first it flourishes, then, as time goes on, like a floweret it fades and passes away, but what is true and sincere has a deep root.

**[22:10]** 113.

**[22:11]** To prove by examples our assertion that what is feigned cannot last, but flourishing just for a time quickly fails, we will take one example of pretence and falsehood from that family, from which we have already drawn so many examples to show their growth in virtue.

**[22:12]** 114.

**[22:13]** Absalom was King David's son, known for his beauty, of splendid appearance and in the heyday of youth; so that no other such man as he was found in Israel.

**[22:14]** He was without a blemish from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

**[22:15]** He had for himself a chariot and horses and fifty men to run before him.

**[22:16]** He rose at early dawn and stood before the gate in the way, and whoever he knew to be seeking the judgment of the king, he called to himself, saying: "From what city art thou?" And he answered: "I thy servant am of one of the tribes of Israel".

**[22:17]** And Absalom answered: "Thy words are good and right.

**[22:18]** Is there none given thee by the king to hear thee? Who will make me a judge? And whosoever will come unto me, that hath need of judgment, I will give him justice".

**[22:19]** With such words he cajoled them.

**[22:20]** And when they came to make obeisance to him, stretching forth his hand he took hold of them and kissed them.

**[22:21]** So he turned the hearts of all to himself.

**[22:22]** For flattery of this sort quickly finds its way to touch the very depths of the heart.

**[22:23]** 115.

**[22:24]** Those spoilt and ambitious men chose what for a time seemed an honour to them, and was pleasing and enjoyable.

**[22:25]** But whilst that delay took place, which the prophet, being prudent above all, thought ought to intervene, they could no longer hold out or bear it.

**[22:26]** Then David having no doubt about the victory commended his son to those who went out to fight, so that they should spare him.

**[22:27]** He would not engage in the battle himself lest he should seem to be taking up arms against one who was still his son, though attempting to destroy his father.

**[22:28]** 116.

**[22:29]** It is clear, then, that those things are lasting and sound, which are true and grow out of a sincere and not a false heart.

**[22:30]** Those, however, which are brought about by pretence and adulation can never last for long.

**[23:1]** Chapter XXIII.

**[23:2]** The good faith of those who are easily bought over with money or flattery is a frail thing to trust to.

**[23:3]** 117.

**[23:4]** Who would suppose that those who are bought over to obedience by money, or those who are allured by adulation, would ever be faithful to them? For the former are ever ready to sell themselves, whilst the latter cannot put up with a hard rule.

**[23:5]** They are easily won with a little adulation, but if one reproves them by a word, they murmur against it, they give one up, they go away with hostile feelings, they forsake one in anger.

**[23:6]** They prefer to rule rather than to obey.

**[23:7]** They think that those whom they ought to have placed over them ought to be subject to themselves, as though indebted to them by their kindness.

**[23:8]** 118.

**[23:9]** What man is there that thinks those will be faithful to himself, whom he believes he will have to bind to himself by money or flattery? For he who takes thy money supposes that he is cheaply held, and looked down upon, unless the money is paid again and again.

**[23:10]** So he frequently expects his price; whilst the other, who is met with prayer and flattery, is always wanting to be asked.

**[24:1]** Chapter XXIV.

**[24:2]** We must strive for preferment only by right means.

**[24:3]** An office undertaken must be carried out wisely and with moderation.

**[24:4]** The inferior clergy should not detract from the bishop's reputation by feigned virtues; nor again, should the bishop be jealous of a cleric, but he should be just in all things and especially in giving judgment.

**[24:5]** 119.

**[24:6]** I think, then, that one should strive to win preferment, especially in the Church, only by good actions and with a right aim; so that there may be no proud conceit, no idle carelessness, no shameful disposition of mind, no unseemly ambition.

**[24:7]** A plain simplicity of mind is enough for everything, and commends itself quite sufficiently.

**[24:8]** 120.

**[24:9]** When in office, again, it is not right to be harsh and severe, nor may one be too easy; lest on the one hand we should seem to be exercising a despotic power, and on the other to be by no means filling the office we had taken up.

**[24:10]** 121.

**[24:11]** We must strive also to win many by kindnesses and duties that we can do, and to preserve the favour already shown us.

**[24:12]** For they will with good reason forget the  benefits of former times if they are now vexed at some great wrong.

**[24:13]** For it often enough happens that those one has shown favour to and allowed to rise step by step, are driven away, if one decides in some unworthy way to put another before them.

**[24:14]** But it is seemly for a priest to show such favour in his kindnesses and his decisions as to guard equity, and to show regard to the other clergy as to parents.

**[24:15]** 122.

**[24:16]** Those who once stood approved should not now become overbearing, but rather, as mindful of the grace they have received, stand firm in their humility.

**[24:17]** A priest ought not to be offended if either cleric or attendant or any ecclesiastic should win regard for himself, by showing mercy, or by fasting, or by uprightness of life, or by teaching and reading.

**[24:18]** For the grace of the Church is the praise of the teacher.

**[24:19]** It is a good thing that the work of another should be praised, if only it be done without any desire to boast.

**[24:20]** For each one should receive praise from the lips of his neighbour, and not from his own mouth, and each one should be commended by the work he has done, not merely by the wishes he had.

**[24:21]** 123.

**[24:22]** But if any one is disobedient to his bishop and wishes to exalt and upraise himself, and to overshadow his bishop's merits by a feigned appearance of learning or humility or mercy, he is wandering from the truth in his pride; for the rule of truth is, to do nothing to advance one's own cause whereby another loses ground, nor to use whatever good one has to the disgrace or blame of another.

**[24:23]** 124.

**[24:24]** Never protect a wicked man, nor allow the sacred things to be given over to an unworthy one; on the other hand, do not harass and press hard on a man whose fault is not clearly proved.

**[24:25]** Injustice quickly gives offence in every case, but especially in the Church, where equity ought to exist, where like treatment should be given to all, so that a powerful person may not claim the more, nor a rich man appropriate the more.

**[24:26]** For whether we be poor or rich, we are one in Christ.

**[24:27]** Let him that lives a holier life claim nothing more thereby for himself; for he ought rather to be the more humble for it.

**[24:28]** 125.

**[24:29]** In giving judgment let us have no respect of persons.

**[24:30]** Favour must be put out of sight, and the case be decided on its merits.

**[24:31]** Nothing is so great a strain on another's good opinion or confidence, as the fact of our giving away the cause of the weaker to the more powerful in any case that comes before us.

**[24:32]** The same happens if we are hard on the poor, whilst we make excuses for the rich man when guilty.

**[24:33]** Men are ready enough to flatter those in high positions, so as not to let them think themselves injured, or to feel vexed as though overthrown.

**[24:34]** But if thou fearest to give offence then do not undertake to give judgment.

**[24:35]** If thou art a priest or some cleric do not urge it.

**[24:36]** It is allowable for thee to be silent in the matter, if it be a money affair, though it is always due to consistency to be on the side of equity.

**[24:37]** But in the cause of God, where there is danger to the whole Church, it is no small sin to act as though one saw nothing.

**[25:1]** Chapter XXV.

**[25:2]** Benefits should be conferred on the poor rather than on the rich, for these latter either think a return is expected from them, or else they are angry at seeming to be indebted for such an action.

**[25:3]** But the poor man makes God the debtor in his place, and freely owns to the benefits he has received.

**[25:4]** To these remarks is added a warning to despise riches.

**[25:5]** 126.

**[25:6]** But what advantage is it to thee to show favour to a rich man? Is it that he is more ready to repay one who loves him? For we generally show favour to those from whom we expect to receive a return of favour.

**[25:7]** But we ought to think far more of the weak and helpless, because we hope to receive, on behalf of him who has it not, a recompense from the Lord Jesus, Who in the likeness of a marriage feast has given us a general representation of virtue.

**[25:8]** By this He bids us confer benefits rather on those who cannot give them to us in return, teaching us to bid to our feasts and meals, not those who are rich, but those that are poor.

**[25:9]** For the rich seem to be asked that they may prepare a banquet for us in return; the poor, as they have nothing wherewith to make return, when they receive anything, make the Lord to be our recompense Who has offered Himself as surety for the poor.

**[25:10]** 127.

**[25:11]** In the ordinary course of things, too, the conferring of a benefit on the poor is of more use than when it is conferred on the rich.

**[25:12]** The rich man scorns the benefit and is ashamed to feel indebted for a favour.

**[25:13]** Nay, moreover, whatever is offered to him he takes as due to his merits, as though only a just debt were paid him; or else he thinks it was but given because the giver expected a still greater return to be made him by the rich man.

**[25:14]** So, in accepting a kindness, the  rich man, on that very ground, thinks that he has given more than he ever received.

**[25:15]** The poor man, however, though he has no money wherewith he can repay, at least shows his gratitude.

**[25:16]** And herein it is certain that he returns more than he received.

**[25:17]** For money is paid in coins, but gratitude never fails; money grows less by payment, but gratitude fails when held back, and is preserved when given to others.

**[25:18]** Next—a thing the rich man avoids—the poor man owns that he feels bound by the debt.

**[25:19]** He really thinks help has been given him, not that it has been offered in return for his honour.

**[25:20]** He considers that his children have been again given him, that his life is restored and his family preserved.

**[25:21]** How much better, then, is it to confer benefits upon the good than on the ungrateful.

**[25:22]** 128.

**[25:23]** Wherefore the Lord said to His disciples: "Take neither gold nor silver nor money".

**[25:24]** Whereby as with a sickle He cuts off the love of money that is ever growing up in human hearts.

**[25:25]** Peter also said to the lame man, who was always carried even from his mother's womb: "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have give I thee.

**[25:26]** In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk".

**[25:27]** So he gave not money, but he gave health.

**[25:28]** How much better it is to have health without money, than money without health! The lame man rose; he had not hoped for that: he received no money; though he had hoped for that.

**[25:29]** But riches are hardly to be found among the saints of the Lord, so as to become objects of contempt to them.

**[26:1]** Chapter XXVI.

**[26:2]** How long standing an evil love of money is, is plain from many examples in the Old Testament.

**[26:3]** And yet it is plain, too, how idle a thing the possession of money is.

**[26:4]** 129.

**[26:5]** But man's habits have so long applied themselves to this admiration of money, that no one is thought worthy of honour unless he is rich.

**[26:6]** This is no new habit.

**[26:7]** Nay, this vice (and that makes the matter worse) grew long years ago in the hearts of men.

**[26:8]** When the city of Jericho fell at the sound of the priests' trumpets, and Joshua the son of Nun gained the victory, he knew that the valour of the people was weakened through love of money and desire for gold.

**[26:9]** For when Achan had taken a garment of gold and two hundred shekels of silver and a golden ingot from the spoils of the ruined city, he was brought before the Lord, and could not deny the theft, but owned it.

**[26:10]** 130.

**[26:11]** Love of money, then, is an old, an ancient vice, which showed itself even at the declaration of the divine law; for a law was given to check it.

**[26:12]** On account of love of money Balak thought Balaam could be tempted by rewards to curse the people of our fathers.

**[26:13]** Love of money would have won the day too, had not God bidden him hold back from cursing.

**[26:14]** Overcome by love of money Achan led to destruction all the people of the fathers.

**[26:15]** So Joshua the son of Nun, who could stay the sun from setting, could not stay the love of money in man from creeping on.

**[26:16]** At the sound of his voice the sun stood still, but love of money stayed not.

**[26:17]** When the sun stood still Joshua completed his triumph, but when love of money went on, he almost lost the victory.

**[26:18]** 131.

**[26:19]** Why? Did not the woman Delilah's love of money deceive Samson, the bravest man of all? So he who had torn asunder the roaring lion with his hands; who, when bound and handed over to his enemies, alone, without help, burst his bonds and slew a thousand of them; who broke the cords interwoven with sinews as though they were but the slight threads of a net; he, I say, having laid his head on the woman's knee, was robbed of the decoration of his victory-bringing hair, that which gave him his might.

**[26:20]** Money flowed into the lap of the woman, and the favour of God forsook the man.

**[26:21]** 132.

**[26:22]** Love of money, then, is deadly.

**[26:23]** Seductive is money, whilst it also defiles those who have it, and helps not those who have it not.

**[26:24]** Supposing that money sometimes is a help, yet it is only a help to a poor man who makes his want known.

**[26:25]** What good is it to him who does not long for it, nor seek it; who does not need its help and is not turned aside by pursuit of it? What good is it to others, if he who has it is alone the richer for it? Is he therefore more honourable because he has that whereby honour is often lost, because he has what he must guard rather than possess? We possess what we use, but what is beyond our use brings us no fruit of possession, but only the danger of watching.

**[27:1]** Chapter XXVII.

**[27:2]** In contempt of money there is the pattern of justice, which virtue bishops and clerics ought to aim at together with some others.

**[27:3]** A few words are added on the duty of not bringing an excommunication too quickly into force.

**[27:4]** 133.

**[27:5]** To come to an end; we know that contempt of riches is a form of justice, therefore we ought to avoid love of money, and strive with all our powers never to do anything against justice, but to guard it in all our deeds and actions.

**[27:6]** 134.

**[27:7]** If we would please God, we must have love, we must be of one mind, we must follow humility, each one thinking the other higher than himself.

**[27:8]** This is true humility, when one never claims anything proudly for oneself, but thinks oneself to be the inferior.

**[27:9]** The bishop should treat the clerics and attendants, who are indeed his sons, as members of himself, and give to each one that duty for which he sees him to be fit.

**[27:10]** 135.

**[27:11]** Not without pain is a limb of the body cut off which has become corrupt.

**[27:12]** It is treated for a long time, to see if it can be cured with various remedies.

**[27:13]** If it cannot be cured, then it is cut off by a good physician.

**[27:14]** Thus it is a good bishop's desire to wish to heal the weak, to remove the spreading ulcers, to burn some parts and not to cut them off; and lastly, when they cannot be healed, to cut them off with pain to himself.

**[27:15]** Wherefore that beautiful rule of the Apostle stands forth brightly, that we should look each one, not on his own things, but on the things of others.

**[27:16]** In this way it will never come about that we shall in anger give way to our own feelings, or concede more than is right in favour to our own wishes.

**[28:1]** Chapter XXVIII.

**[28:2]** Mercy must be freely shown even though it brings an odium of its own.

**[28:3]** With regard to this, reference is made to the well-known story about the sacred vessels which were broken up by Ambrose to pay for the redemption of captives; and very beautiful advice is given about the right use of the gold and silver which the Church possesses.

**[28:4]** Next, after showing from the action of holy Lawrence what are the true treasures of the Church, certain rules are laid down which ought to be observed in melting down and employing for such uses the consecrated vessels of the Church.

**[28:5]** 136.

**[28:6]** It is a very great incentive to mercy to share in others' misfortunes, to help the needs of others as far as our means allow, and sometimes even beyond them.

**[28:7]** For it is better for mercy's sake to take up a case, or to suffer odium rather than to show hard feeling.

**[28:8]** So I once brought odium on myself because I broke up the sacred vessels to redeem captives—a fact that could displease the Arians.

**[28:9]** Not that it displeased them as an act, but as being a thing in which they could take hold of something for which to blame me.

**[28:10]** Who can be so hard, cruel, iron-hearted, as to be displeased because a man is redeemed from death, or a woman from barbarian impurities, things that are worse than death, or boys and girls and infants from the pollution of idols, whereby through fear of death they were defiled?  137.

**[28:11]** Although we did not act thus without good reason, yet we have followed it up among the people so as to confess and to add again and again that it was far better to preserve souls than gold for the Lord.

**[28:12]** For He Who sent the apostles without gold also brought together the churches without gold.

**[28:13]** The Church has gold, not to store up, but to lay out, and to spend on those who need.

**[28:14]** What necessity is there to guard what is of no good? Do we not know how much gold and silver the Assyrians took out of the temple of the Lord? Is it not much better that the priests should melt it down for the sustenance of the poor, if other supplies fail, than that a sacrilegious enemy should carry it off and defile it? Would not the Lord Himself say: Why didst thou suffer so many needy to die of hunger? Surely thou hadst gold? Thou shouldst have given them sustenance.

**[28:15]** Why are so many captives brought on the slave market, and why are so many unredeemed left to be slain by the enemy? It had been better to preserve living vessels than gold ones.

**[28:16]** 138.

**[28:17]** To this no answer could be given.

**[28:18]** For what wouldst thou say: I feared that the temple of God would need its ornaments? He would answer: The sacraments need not gold, nor are they proper to gold only—for they are not bought with gold.

**[28:19]** The glory of the sacraments is the redemption of captives.

**[28:20]** Truly they are precious vessels, for they redeem men from death.

**[28:21]** That, indeed, is the true treasure of the Lord which effects what His blood effected.

**[28:22]** Then, indeed, is the vessel of the Lord's blood recognized, when one sees in either redemption, so that the chalice redeems from the enemy those whom His blood redeemed from sin.

**[28:23]** How beautifully it is said, when long lines of captives are redeemed by the Church: These Christ has redeemed.

**[28:24]** Behold the gold that can be tried, behold the useful gold, behold the gold of Christ which frees from death, behold the gold whereby modesty is redeemed and chastity is preserved.

**[28:25]** 139.

**[28:26]** These, then, I preferred to hand over to you as free men, rather than to store up the gold.

**[28:27]** This crowd of captives, this company surely is more glorious than the sight of cups.

**[28:28]** The gold of the Redeemer ought to contribute to this work so as to redeem those in danger.

**[28:29]** I recognize the fact that the blood of Christ not only glows in cups of gold, but also by the office of redemption has impressed upon them the power of the divine operation.

**[28:30]** 140.

**[28:31]** Such gold the holy martyr Lawrence preserved for the Lord.

**[28:32]** For when the treasures of the Church were demanded from him, he promised that he would show them.

**[28:33]** On the following day he brought the poor together.

**[28:34]** When asked where the treasures were which he had promised, he pointed to the poor, saying: "These are the treasures of the Church".

**[28:35]** And truly they were treasures, in whom Christ lives, in whom there is faith in Him.

**[28:36]** So, too, the Apostle says: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels".

**[28:37]** What greater treasures has Christ than those in whom He says He Himself lives? For thus it is written: "I was hungry and ye gave Me to eat, I was thirsty and ye gave Me to drink, I was a stranger and ye took Me in".

**[28:38]** And again: "What thou didst to one of these, thou didst it unto Me".

**[28:39]** What better treasures has Jesus than those in which He loves to be seen?  141.

**[28:40]** These treasures Lawrence pointed out, and prevailed, for the persecutors could not take them away.

**[28:41]** Jehoiachim, who preserved his gold during the siege and spent it not in providing food, saw his gold carried off, and himself led into captivity.

**[28:42]** Lawrence, who preferred to spend the gold of the Church on the poor, rather than to keep it in hand for the persecutor, received the sacred crown of martyrdom for the unique and deep-sighted vigour of his meaning.

**[28:43]** Or was it perhaps said to holy Lawrence: "Thou shouldst not spend the treasures of the Church, or sell the sacred vessels"?  142.

**[28:44]** It is necessary that every one should fill this office, with genuine good faith and clear-sighted forethought.

**[28:45]** If any one derives profit from it for himself it is a crime, but if he spends the treasures on the poor, or redeems captives, he shows mercy.

**[28:46]** For no one can say: Why does the poor man live? None can complain that captives are redeemed, none can find fault because a temple of the Lord is built, none can be angry because a plot of ground has been enlarged for the burial of the bodies of the faithful, none can be vexed because in the tombs of the Christians there is rest for the dead.

**[28:47]** In these three ways it is allowable to break up, melt down, or sell even the sacred vessels of the Church.

**[28:48]** 143.

**[28:49]** It is necessary to see that the mystic cup does not go out of the Church, lest the service of the sacred chalice should be turned over to base uses.

**[28:50]** Therefore vessels were first sought for in the Church which had not been consecrated to such holy uses.

**[28:51]** Then broken up and afterwards melted down, they were given to the poor in small payments, and were also used for the ransom of captives.

**[28:52]** But if new vessels fail, or those which never seem to have been used for such a holy purpose, then, as I have already said, I think that all might be put to this use without irreverence.

**[29:1]** Chapter XXIX.

**[29:2]** The property of widows or of all the faithful, that has been entrusted to the Church, ought to be defended though it brings danger to oneself.

**[29:3]** This is illustrated by the example of Onias the priest, and of Ambrose, bishop of Ticinum.

**[29:4]** 144.

**[29:5]** Great care must be taken that the property entrusted by widows remains inviolate.

**[29:6]** It should be guarded without causing complaint, not only if it belongs to widows, but to any one at all.

**[29:7]** For good faith must be shown to all, though the cause of the widow and orphans comes first.

**[29:8]** 145.

**[29:9]** So everything entrusted to the temple was preserved in the name of the widows alone, as we read in the book of the Maccabees.

**[29:10]** For when information was given of the money, which Simon treacherously had told King Antiochus could be found in large quantities in the temple at Jerusalem, Heliodorus was sent to look into the matter.

**[29:11]** He came to the temple, and made known to the high priest his hateful information and the reason of his coming.

**[29:12]** 146.

**[29:13]** Then the priest said that only means for the maintenance of the widows and orphans was laid up there.

**[29:14]** And when Heliodorus would have gone to seize it, and to claim it on the king's behalf, the, priests cast themselves before the altar, after putting on their priestly robes, and with tears called on the living God Who had given them the law concerning trust-money to show Himself as guardian of His own commands.

**[29:15]** The changed look and colour of the high priest showed what grief of soul and anxiety and tension of mind were his.

**[29:16]** All wept, for the spot would fall into contempt, if not even in the temple of God safe and faithful guardianship could be preserved.

**[29:17]** Women with breasts girded, and virgins who usually were shut in, knocked at the doors.

**[29:18]** Some ran to the walls, others looked out of the windows, all raised their hands to heaven in prayer that God would stand by His laws.

**[29:19]** 147.

**[29:20]** But Heliodorus, undeterred by this, was eager to carry out his intention, and had already surrounded the treasury with his followers, when suddenly there appeared to him a dreadful horseman all glorious in golden armour, his horse also being adorned with costly ornaments.

**[29:21]** Two other youths also appeared in glorious might and wondrous beauty, in splendour and glory and beauteous array.

**[29:22]** They stood round him, and on either side beat the sacrilegious wretch, and gave him stroke after stroke without intermission.

**[29:23]** What more need I say? Shut in by darkness he fell to the ground, and lay there nearly dead with fear at this plain proof of divine power, nor had he any hope of safety left within him.

**[29:24]** Joy returned to those who were in fear, fear fell on those who were so proud before.

**[29:25]** And some of the friends of Heliodorus in their trouble besought Onias, asking life for him, since he was almost at his last breath.

**[29:26]** 148.

**[29:27]** When, therefore, the high priest asked for this, the same youths again appeared to Heliodorus, clad in the same garments, and said to him: Give thanks to Onias the high priest, for whose sake thy life is granted thee.

**[29:28]** But do thou, having experienced the scourge of God, go and tell thy friends how much thou hast learnt of the sanctity of the temple and the power of God.

**[29:29]** With these words they passed out of sight.

**[29:30]** Heliodorus then, his life having come back to him, offered a sacrifice to the Lord, gave thanks to the priest Onias, and returned with his army to the king, saying: "If thou hast an enemy or one who is plotting against thy power, send him thither and thou wilt receive him back well scourged".

**[29:31]** 149.

**[29:32]** Therefore, my sons, good faith must be preserved in the case of trust-money, and care, too, must be shown.

**[29:33]** Your service will glow the brighter if the oppression of a powerful man, which some widow or orphan cannot withstand, is checked by the assistance of the Church, and if ye show that the command of the Lord has more weight with you than the favour of the rich.

**[29:34]** 150.

**[29:35]** Ye also remember how often we entered on a contest against the royal attacks, on behalf of the trust-money belonging to widows, yea, and to others as well.

**[29:36]** You and I shared this in common.

**[29:37]** I will also mention the late case of the Church at Ticinum, which was in danger of losing the widow's trust-money that it had received.

**[29:38]** For when he who wanted to claim it on some imperial rescript demanded it, the clergy did not maintain their rights.

**[29:39]** For they themselves, having once been called to office and sent to intervene, now supposed that they could not oppose the emperor's orders.

**[29:40]** The plain words of the rescript were read, the orders of the chief officer of the court were there, he who was to act in the matter was at hand.

**[29:41]** What more was to be said? It was handed over.

**[29:42]** 151.

**[29:43]** However, after taking counsel with me, the holy bishop took possession of the rooms to which he knew that the widow's property had been carried.

**[29:44]** As it could not be carried away, it was all set down in writing.

**[29:45]** Later on it was again demanded on proof of the document.

**[29:46]** The emperor repeated the order, and would meet us himself in his own person.

**[29:47]** We refused.

**[29:48]** And when the force of the divine law, and a long list of passages and the danger of Heliodorus was explained, at length the emperor became reasonable.

**[29:49]** Afterwards, again, an attempt was made to seize it, but the good bishop anticipated the attempt and restored to the widow all he had received.

**[29:50]** So faith was preserved, but the oppression was no longer a cause for fear; for now it is the matter itself, not good faith, that is in danger.

**[30:1]** Chapter XXX.

**[30:2]** The ending of the book brings an exhortation to avoid ill-will, and to seek prudence, faith, and the other virtues.

**[30:3]** 152.

**[30:4]** My sons, avoid wicked men, guard against the envious.

**[30:5]** There is this difference between a wicked and an envious man: the wicked man is delighted at his own good fortune, but the envious is tortured at the  thought of another's.

**[30:6]** The former loves evil, the latter hates good.

**[30:7]** So he is almost more bearable who desires good for himself alone, than he who desires evil for all.

**[30:8]** 153.

**[30:9]** My sons, think before you act, and when you have thought long then do what you consider right.

**[30:10]** When the opportunity of a praiseworthy death is given let it be seized at once.

**[30:11]** Glory that is put off flies away and is not easily laid hold of again.

**[30:12]** 154.

**[30:13]** Love faith.

**[30:14]** For by his devotion and faith Josiah won great love for himself from his enemies.

**[30:15]** For he celebrated the Lord's passover when he was eighteen years old, as no one had done it before him.

**[30:16]** As then in zeal he was superior to those who went before him, so do ye, my sons, show zeal for God.

**[30:17]** Let zeal for God search you through, and devour you, so that each one of you may say: "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

**[30:18]** " An apostle of Christ was called the zealot.

**[30:19]** But why do I speak of an apostle? The Lord Himself said: "The zeal of thine house hath eaten Me up".

**[30:20]** Let it then be real zeal for God, not mean earthy zeal, for that causes jealousy.

**[30:21]** 155.

**[30:22]** Let there be peace among you, which passeth all understanding.

**[30:23]** Love one another.

**[30:24]** Nothing is sweeter than charity, nothing more blessed than peace.

**[30:25]** Ye yourselves know that I have ever loved you and do now love you above all others.

**[30:26]** As the children of one father ye have become united under the bond of brotherly affection.

**[30:27]** 156.

**[30:28]** Whatsoever is good, that hold fast; and the God of peace and love be with you in the Lord Jesus, to Whom be honour and glory, dominion and might, together with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen.
