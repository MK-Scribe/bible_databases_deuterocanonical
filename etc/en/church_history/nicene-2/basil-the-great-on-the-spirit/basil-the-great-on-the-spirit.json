Furthermore what boundless lack of sensibility does it not shew in these men to confess that the Saints are with Christ, (if, as we know is the case, Paul, on becoming absent from the body, is present with the Lord, and, after departing, is with Christ) and, so far as lies in their power, to refuse to allow to the Spirit to be with Christ even to the same extent as men? And Paul calls himself a \"labourer together with God\" in the dispensation of the Gospel; will they bring an indictment for impiety against us, if we apply the term \"fellow-labourer\" to the Holy Spirit, through whom in every creature under heaven the Gospel bringeth forth fruit? The life of them that have trusted in the Lord \"is hidden,\" it would seem, \"with Christ in God, and when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall\" they themselves also \"appear with Him in glory;\" and is the Spirit of life Himself, \"Who made us free from the law of sin,\" not with Christ, both in the secret and hidden life with Him, and in the manifestation of the glory which we expect to be manifested in the saints? We are \"heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,\" and is the Spirit without part or lot in the fellowship of God and of His Christ? \"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God;\" and are we not to allow to the Spirit even that testimony of His fellowship with God which we have learnt from the Lord? For the height of folly is reached if we through the faith in Christ which is in the Spirit hope that we shall be raised together with Him and sit together in heavenly places, whenever He shall change our vile body from the natural to the spiritual, and yet refuse to assign to the Spirit any share in the sitting together, or in the glory, or anything else which we have received from Him."
