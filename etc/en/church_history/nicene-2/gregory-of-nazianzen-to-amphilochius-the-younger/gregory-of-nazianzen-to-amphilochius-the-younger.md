# Gregory of Nazianzen: To Amphilochius the Younger

**[1:1]** 5.

**[1:2]** To Amphilochius the Younger.

**[1:3]** Ep.

**[1:4]** IX.

**[1:5]** (Constantine and Constantius had granted exemption from the military tax to all clerics.

**[1:6]** This privilege was, however, abolished by Julian, and was restored by Valentinian and Valens: but the collectors of revenue often tried to levy it on them in spite of the exemption.

**[1:7]** The collector at Nazianzus tried to do this in the case of a Deacon named Euthalius, in whose behalf Gregory wrote the following letter to Amphilochius, who was at the time one of the principal magistrates of the province.

**[1:8]** The date of the letter is given as a.

**[1:9]** d.

**[1:10]** 372, the year of Gregory's Ordination to the Priesthood.

**[1:11]** For further particulars about this Amphilochius, see introd.

**[1:12]** to letters II.

**[1:13]** and III.

**[1:14]** to Caesarius Epp.

**[1:15]** 22, 23.

**[1:16]** )  Support a wellbuilt chamber with columns of gold, as Pindar says, and make yourself from the beginning known to us on the right side in our present anxiety, that you may build yourself a notable palace, and shew yourself in it with a good fame.

**[1:17]** But how will you do this? By honouring God and the things of God, than Whom there can be nothing greater in your eyes.

**[1:18]** But how, and by what act can you honour Him? By this one act, by protecting the servants of God and ministers of the altar.

**[1:19]** One of these is our fellow deacon Euthalius, on whom, I know not how, the officers of the Prefecture are trying to impose a payment of gold after his promotion to the higher rank.

**[1:20]** Pray do not allow this.

**[1:21]** Reach a hand to this deacon and to the whole clergy, and above all to me, for whom you care; for otherwise he would have to endure a grievous wrong, alone of men deprived of the kindness of the time and the privilege granted by the Emperor to the Clergy, and would even be insulted and fined, possibly on account of my weakness.

**[1:22]** It would be well for you to prevent this even if others are not well disposed.

**[1:23]** Ep.

**[1:24]** XIII.

**[1:25]** (See the first letter to Sophronius.

**[1:26]** The nature of the trouble here alluded to is unknown.

**[1:27]** There are several letters to various persons in reference to his troubles and difficulties, many of them coming from his reluctance to undertake the duties of any public office.

**[1:28]** He died at an early age, leaving his widow, Alypiana, with a large family to bring up in very reduced circumstances.

**[1:29]** Her troubles and the education of her children were matters of much concern to Gregory, whose frequent letters on the subject will be found below.

**[1:30]** )  I approve the statement of Theognis, who, while not praising the friendship which goes no further than cups and pleasures, praises that which extends to actions in these words,  Beside a full wine cup a man has many friends:  But they are fewer when grave troubles press.

**[1:31]** We, however, have not shared winecups with each other, nor indeed have we often met (though we ought to have been very careful to do so, both for our own sake, and for the sake of the friendship which we inherited from our fathers), but we do ask for the goodwill which shews itself in acts.

**[1:32]** A struggle is at hand, and a very serious struggle.

**[1:33]** My son Nicobulus has got into unexpected troubles, from a quarter from which troubles would least be looked for.

**[1:34]** Therefore I beg you to come and help us as soon as you can, both to take part in trying the case, and to plead our cause, if you find that a wrong is being done us.

**[1:35]** But if you cannot come, at any rate do not let yourself be previously retained by the other side, or sell for a small gain the freedom which we know from everybody's testimony has always characterized you.

**[1:36]** Ep.

**[1:37]** XXV.

**[1:38]** (Amphilochius was acquitted of the charges made against him, referred to in former letters; but the result of the accusation on his own mind was such that he resigned his office, and retired to a sort of hermitage at a place called Ozizala, not far from Nazianzus, where he devoted his hours of labour to the cultivation of vegetables.

**[1:39]** The four letters which follow are of no special importance, and are only given as specimens of the lighter style which Gregory could use with his intimate friends.

**[1:40]** )  I did not ask you for bread, just as I would not ask for water from the inhabitants of Ostracine.

**[1:41]** But if I were to ask for vegetables from a man of Ozizala it were no strange thing, nor too great a strain on friendship; for you have plenty of them, and we a great dearth.

**[1:42]** I beg you then to send me some vegetables, and plenty of them, and the best quality, or as many as you can (for even small things are great to the poor); for I am going to receive the great Basil, and you, who have had experience of him full and philosophical, would not like to know him hungry and irritated.

**[1:43]** Ep.

**[1:44]** XXVI.

**[1:45]** What a very small quantity of vegetables you have sent me! They must surely be golden vegetables! And yet your whole wealth consists of orchards and rivers and groves and gardens, and your country is productive of vegetables as other lands are of gold, and  You dwell among meadowy leafage.

**[1:46]** But corn is for you a fabulous happiness, and your bread is the bread of angels, as the saying is, so welcome is it, and so little can you reckon upon it.

**[1:47]** Either, then, send me your vegetables less grudgingly, orâ€”I won't threaten you with anything else, but I won't send you any corn, and will see whether there is any truth in the saying that grasshoppers live on dew!      Ep.

**[1:48]** XXVII.

**[1:49]** You make a joke of it; but I know the danger of an Ozizalean starving when he has taken most pains with his husbandry.

**[1:50]** There is only this praise to be given them, that even if they die of hunger they smell sweet, and have a gorgeous funeral.

**[1:51]** How so? Because they are covered with plenty of all sorts of flowers.

**[1:52]** Ep.

**[1:53]** XXVIII.

**[1:54]** In visiting the mountain cities which border on Pamphylia I fished up in the Mountains a sea Glaucus; I did not drag the fish out of the depths with a net of flax, but I snared my game with the love of a friend.

**[1:55]** And having once taught my Glaucus to travel by land, I sent him as the bearer of a letter to Your Goodness.

**[1:56]** Please receive him kindly, and honour him with the hospitality commended in the Bible, not forgetting the vegetables.

**[1:57]** Ep.

**[1:58]** LXII.

**[1:59]** (The Armenian referred to is probably Eustathius Bishop of Sebaste, the capital of Armenia Minor.

**[1:60]** He had been a disciple of Arius, but more than once professed the Nicene Faith, changing his opinions with his company.

**[1:61]** His personal character however stood very high, and for a long time S.

**[1:62]** Basil regarded him with affectionate esteem.

**[1:63]** Indeed S.

**[1:64]** Basil's Rule for Monks is based on one drawn up by him.

**[1:65]** But after Basil's elevation to the Episcopate Eustathius began to oppose him and to calumniate him on all sides, and even entered openly into communion with the Arians.

**[1:66]** It would seem that this man tried to get Amphilochius round to his side, and through him Gregory.

**[1:67]** )  The Injunction of your inimitable Honour is not barbaric, but Greek, or rather christian; but as for the Armenian on whom you pride yourself so, he is a downright barbarian, and far from our honour.

**[1:68]** Ep.

**[1:69]** LXIII.

**[1:70]** To Amphilochius the Elder.

**[1:71]** (In a.

**[1:72]** d.

**[1:73]** 374 Amphilochius was made Bishop of Iconium; and his father, a man of the same name, was deeply aggrieved at being thus deprived of his son, to whom he had looked to support him in his old age, and accused Gregory of being the cause.

**[1:74]** Gregory, who had just lost his own father, writes to undeceive him, and to convince him how much he dreads the burden of the responsibilities of the episcopate for his friend as well as for himself.

**[1:75]** )  Are you grieving? I, of course, am full of joy! Are you weeping? I, as you see, am keeping festival and glorying in the present state of things! Are you grieved because your son is taken from you and promoted to honour on account of his virtue, and do you think it a terrible misfortune that he is no longer with you to tend your old age, and, as his custom is, to bestow on you all due care and service? But it is no grief to me that my father has left me for the last journey, from which he will return to me no more, and I shall never see him again! Then I for my part do not blame you, nor do I ask you for due condolence, knowing as I do that private troubles allow no leisure for those of strangers; for no man is so friendly and so philosophical as to be above his own suffering and to comfort another when needing comfort himself.

**[1:76]** But you on the contrary heap blow on blow, when you blame me, as I hear you do, and think that your son and my brother is neglected by us, or even betrayed by us, which is a still heavier charge; or that we do not recognize the loss which all his friends and relatives have suffered, and I more than all, because I had placed in him my hopes of life, and looked upon him as the only bulwark, the only good counsellor, and the only sharer of my piety.

**[1:77]** And yet, on what grounds do you form this opinion? If on the first, be assured that I came over to you on purpose, and because I was troubled by the rumour, and I was ready to share your deliberations while it was still time for consultation about the matter; and you imparted anything to me rather than this, whether because you were in the same distress, or with some other purpose, I know not what.

**[1:78]** But if the last, I was prevented from meeting you again by my grief, and the honour I owed my father, and his funeral, over which I could not give anything precedence, and that when my sorrow was fresh, and it would not only have been wrong but also quite improper to be unseasonably philosophical, and above human nature.

**[1:79]** Moreover, I thought that I was previously engaged by the circumstances, especially as his had come to such a conclusion as seemed good to Him who governs all our affairs.

**[1:80]** So much concerning this matter.

**[1:81]** Now I beg you to put aside your grief, which is most unreasonable I am sure; and if you have any further grievance, bring it forward that you may not grieve both me in part and yourself, and put yourself in a position unworthy of your nobility, blaming me instead of others, though I have done you no wrong, but, if I must say the truth, have been equally tyrannized over by our common friend, although you used to think me your only benefactor.

**[1:82]** Ep.

**[1:83]** CLXXI.

**[1:84]** To Amphilochius, Bishop of Iconium.

**[1:85]** Scarcely yet delivered from the pains of my illness, I hasten to you, the guardian of my cure.

**[1:86]** For the tongue of a priest meditating of the Lord raises the sick.

**[1:87]** Do then the greater thing in your priestly ministration, and loose the great mass of my sins when you lay hold of the Sacrifice of Resurrection.

**[1:88]** For your affairs are a care to me waking or sleeping, and you are to me a good plectrum, and have made a welltuned lyre to dwell within my soul, because by your numerous letters you have trained my soul to science.

**[1:89]** But, most reverend friend, cease not both to pray and to plead for me when you draw down the Word by your word, when with a bloodless cutting you sever the Body and Blood of the Lord, using your voice for the glaive.

**[1:90]** Ep.

**[1:91]** CLXXXIV.

**[1:92]** (Bosporius, Bishop of Colonia in Cappadocia Secunda, who had apparently taken a prominent part in the election and consecration of Eulalius to the See of Nazianzus, was accused of heresy by Helladius Archbishop of Caesarea, and a Council met at Parnassus to try him, a.

**[1:93]** d.

**[1:94]** 383.

**[1:95]** Gregory, not being able personally to attend this Synod, writes to Amphilochius, to beg him to undertake the defence of the accused.

**[1:96]** The letter is lost, but Gregory's friend carried out his mission with success, and the following letter is to thank him for his kindness.

**[1:97]** )  The Lord fulfil all thy petitions (do not despise a father's prayer), for you have abundantly refreshed my age, both by having gone to Parnassus, as you were invited to do, and by having refuted the calumny against the most Reverend and God-beloved Bishop.

**[1:98]** For evil men love to set down their own faults to those who convict them.

**[1:99]** For the age of this man is stronger than all the accusations, and so is his life, and we too who have often heard from him and taught others, and those whom he has recovered from error and added to the common body of the church; but yet the present evil times called for more accurate proof on account of the slanderers and evil-disposed; and this you have supplied us with, or rather you have supplied it to those who are of fickler mind and easily led away by such men.

**[1:100]** But if you will undertake a longer journey, and will personally give testimony, and settle the matter with the other bishops, you will be doing a spiritual work worthy of your Perfection.

**[1:101]** I and those with me salute your Fraternity.
