# John Cassian: Against Nestorius Book III

**[1:1]** Book III.

**[1:2]** Chapter I.

**[1:3]** That Christ, who is God and man in the unity of Person, sprang from Israel and the Virgin Mary according to the flesh.

**[1:4]** That divine teacher of the Churches when in writing to the Romans he was reproving or rather lamenting the unbelief of the Jews, i-e:, of his own brethren, made use of these words: "I wished myself," said he, "to be accursed from Christ, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as of children, and the glory, and the testaments, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises: whose are the fathers, of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever".

**[1:5]** O, the love of that most faithful Apostle, and most kindly kinsman! who in his infinite charity wished to dieâ€”as a kinsman for his relations, and as a master for his disciples.

**[1:6]** And what then was the reason why he wished to die? Only one; viz.

**[1:7]** , that they might live.

**[1:8]** But in what did their life consist? Simply in this, as he himself says, that they might recognize a Divine Christ born according to the flesh, of their own flesh.

**[1:9]** And therefore the Apostle grieved the more, because those who ought to have loved Him the more as sprung from their own stock, failed to understand that He was born of Israel.

**[1:10]** "Of whom," said he, "is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever".

**[1:11]** Clearly he lays down that from them according to the flesh, was born that Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever.

**[1:12]** You certainly cannot deny that Christ was born from them according to the flesh.

**[1:13]** But the same Person, who was born from them, is God.

**[1:14]** How can you get round this? How can you shuffle out of it? The Apostle says that Christ who was born of Israel according to the flesh, is God.

**[1:15]** Teach us, if you can, at what time He did not exist.

**[1:16]** "Of whom," he says, "is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God".

**[1:17]** You see that because the Apostle has united and joined together these, "God" cannot possibly be separated from "Christ".

**[1:18]** For just as the Apostle declares that Christ is of them, so he asserts that God is in Christ.

**[1:19]** You must either deny both of these statements, or you must accept both.

**[1:20]** Christ is said to be born of them according to the flesh: but the same Person is declared by the Apostle to be "God in Christ".

**[1:21]** Whence also he says elsewhere: "For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself".

**[1:22]** It is absolutely impossible to separate one from the other.

**[1:23]** Either deny that Christ sprang from them, or admit that there was born of the virgin God in Christ, "who is," as he says, "over all, God blessed for ever".

**[2:1]** Chapter II.

**[2:2]** The title of God is given in one sense to Christ, and in another to men.

**[2:3]** The name of God would for the faithful be amply sufficient to denote the glory of His Divinity, but by adding "over all, God blessed," he excludes a blasphemous and perverse interpretation of it, for fear that some evil-disposed person to depreciate His absolute Divinity might quote the fact that the word God is sometimes applied by grace in the Divine economy temporarily to men, and thus apply it to God by unworthy comparisons, as where God says to Moses: "I have given thee as a God to Pharaoh," or in this passage: "I said ye are Gods," where it clearly has the force of a title given by condescension.

**[2:4]** For as it says "I said," it is not a name showing power, so much as a title given by the speaker.

**[2:5]** But that passage also, where it says: "I have given thee as a God to Pharaoh," shows the power of the giver rather than the Divinity of him who receives the title.

**[2:6]** For when it says: "I have given," it thereby certainly indicates the power of God, who gave, and not the Divine nature, in the person of the recipient.

**[2:7]** But when it is said of our God and Lord Jesus Christ, "who is over all, God blessed for ever," the fact is at once proved by the words, and the meaning of the words shown by the name given: because in the case of the Son of God the name of God does not denote an adoption by favour, but what is truly and really His nature.

**[3:1]** Chapter III.

**[3:2]** He explains the apostle's saying: "If from henceforth we know no man according to the flesh," etc.

**[3:3]** And so the same Apostle says: "From henceforth we know no man according to the flesh, and if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer".

**[3:4]** Admirably consistent are all the writings of the sacred word with each other, and in every portion of them: even where they do not correspond in the form of the words, yet they agree in the drift and substance.

**[3:5]** As where he says: "And if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer".

**[3:6]** For the witness of the passage before us confirms that quoted above, in which he said: "Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever".

**[3:7]** For there he writes: "Of whom is Christ according to the flesh;" and here: "if we have known Christ according to the flesh".

**[3:8]** There: "who is over all, God blessed for ever;" and here: "yet now we no longer know Christ according to the flesh".

**[3:9]** The look of the words is different, but their force and drift is the same.

**[3:10]** For it is the same Person whom he there declares to be God over all born according to the flesh, whom he here asserts that he no longer knows according to the flesh.

**[3:11]** And plainly for this reason; viz.

**[3:12]** , because Him whom he had known as born in the flesh, he acknowledges as God for ever; and therefore says that he knows him not after the flesh, because He is over all, God blessed for ever; and the phrase there: "who is over all God," answers to this: "we no longer know Christ according to the flesh;" and this phrase: "we no longer know Christ according to the flesh" implies this: "who is God blessed for ever".

**[3:13]** The declaration of Apostolic teaching then somehow rises, as it were to greater heights, and though it is self-consistent throughout, yet it supports the mystery of the perfect faith, with a still more express statement, and says: "And though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer," i-e:, as formerly we knew Him as man as well as God, yet now only as God.

**[3:14]** For when the frailty of flesh comes to an end, we no longer know anything in Him except the power of Divinity, for all that is in Him is the power of Divine Majesty, where the weakness of human infirmity has ceased to exist.

**[3:15]** In this passage then he has thoroughly expounded the whole mystery of the Incarnation, and of His perfect Divinity.

**[3:16]** For where he says: "And if we have known Christ according to the flesh," he speaks of the mystery of God born in flesh.

**[3:17]** But by adding "yet now we know Him so no longer," he manifests His power when weakness is laid aside.

**[3:18]** And thus that knowledge of the flesh has to do with His humanity, and that ignorance, with the glory of His Divinity.

**[3:19]** For to say "we have known Christ according to the flesh:" means "as long as that which was known, existed.

**[3:20]** Now we no longer know it, after it has ceased to exist.

**[3:21]** For the nature of flesh has been transformed into a spiritual substance: and that which formerly belonged to the manhood, has all become God's.

**[3:22]** And therefore we no longer know Christ according to the flesh, because when bodily infirmity has been absorbed by Divine Majesty, nothing remains in that Sacred Body, from which weakness of the flesh can be known in it.

**[3:23]** And thus whatever had formerly belonged to a twofold substance, has become attached to a single Power.

**[3:24]** Since there is no sort of doubt that Christ, who was crucified through human weakness lives entirely through the glory of His Divinity.

**[4:1]** Chapter IV.

**[4:2]** From the Epistle to the Galatians he brings forward a passage to show that the weakness of the flesh in Christ was absorbed by His Divinity.

**[4:3]** The Apostle indeed declares this in the whole body of his writings, and admirably says in writing to the Galatians: "Paul an Apostle not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father".

**[4:4]** You see how thoroughly consistent he is with himself in the former and the present passage.

**[4:5]** For there he says: "Now we no longer know Christ according to the flesh".

**[4:6]** Here he says: "Not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ".

**[4:7]** It is clear that his doctrine is the same here as in the former passage.

**[4:8]** For where he says that he is not sent by man, he implies: "We have not known Christ according to the flesh:" and so I am "not sent by man" but "by Christ;" for if I am sent by Christ, I am not sent by man but by God.

**[4:9]** For there is no longer room for the name of man, in Him whom Divinity claims entirely for itself.

**[4:10]** And so when he had said that he was sent "not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ," he rightly added: "And God the Father," thus showing that he was sent by God the Father and God the Son; in whom owing to the mystery of the sacred and ineffable generation there are two Persons (He who begets, and He who is begotten), but there is but one single Power of God who is the sender.

**[4:11]** And so in saying that he was sent by God the Father and God the Son, he shows that the Persons are two in number, but he also teaches that their Power is One in sending.

**[5:1]** Chapter V.

**[5:2]** As it is blasphemy to pare away the Divinity of Christ, so also is it blasphemous to deny that He is true man.

**[5:3]** But he says "by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead".

**[5:4]** That renowned and admirable teacher, knowing that our Lord Jesus Christ must be preached as true man, as well as true God, always declares the glory of the Divine in Him, in such a way as not to lose hold of the confession of the Incarnation: plainly excluding the phantasm of Marcion, by a real Incarnation, and the poverty of the Ebionite, by Divinity: lest through one or other of these wicked blasphemies it might be believed that our Lord Jesus Christ was either altogether man without God, or God without man.

**[5:5]** Excellently then did the Apostle, when declaring that He was sent by God the Son as well as by God the Father, add at once a confession of the Lord's Incarnation, by saying: "Who raised Him from the dead:" clearly teaching that it was a real body of the Incarnate God, which was raised from the dead: in accordance with this: "And though we have known Christ according to the flesh," excellently adding: "Yet now we know Him so no longer".

**[5:6]** For he says that he knows this in Him according to the flesh; viz.

**[5:7]** , that He was raised from the dead; but that he knows Him no longer according to the flesh inasmuch as when the weakness of the flesh is at an end, he knows that He exists in the Power of God only.

**[5:8]** Surely he is a faithful and satisfactory witness of our Lord's Divinity which had to be proclaimed, who at his first call was smitten from heaven itself, and did not merely believe in his heart the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead, but actually established its truth by the evidence of his bodily eyes.

**[6:1]** Chapter VI.

**[6:2]** He shows from the appearance of Christ vouchsafed to the Apostle when persecuting the Church, the existence of both natures in Him.

**[6:3]** Wherefore also, when arguing before King Agrippa and others of the world's judges, he speaks as follows: "When I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priests, at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and all those that were with me.

**[6:4]** And when we were all fallen down to the ground, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.

**[6:5]** And I said, Who art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said to me: I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest".

**[6:6]** You see how truly the Apostle said that he no longer knew according to the flesh one whom he had seen in such splendour and majesty.

**[6:7]** For when as he lay prostrate he saw the splendour of that divine light which he was unable to endure, there followed this voice: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" And when he asked who it might be, the Lord answers and clearly points out His Personality: "I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest".

**[6:8]** Now then, you heretic, I ask you, I summon you.

**[6:9]** Do you believe what the Apostle says of himself, or do you not believe it? Or if you think that unimportant, do you believe what the Lord says of Himself or do you not believe it? If you do believe it, there is an end of the matter: for you cannot help believing what we believe.

**[6:10]** For we, like the Apostle, even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet know Him so no longer.

**[6:11]** We do not heap insults on Christ.

**[6:12]** We do not separate the flesh from the Divinity; and all that is in Christ we believe is in God.

**[6:13]** If then you believe the same that we believe you must acknowledge the same mysteries of the faith.

**[6:14]** But if you differ from us, if you refuse to believe the Churches, the Apostle, aye and God's own testimony about Himself, show us in this vision which the Apostle saw, how much is flesh, and how much God.

**[6:15]** For I cannot here separate one from the other.

**[6:16]** I see the ineffable light, I see the inexpressible splendour, I see the radiance that human weakness cannot endure, and beyond what mortal eyes can bear, the glory of God shining with inconceivable light.

**[6:17]** What room is there here for division and separation? In the voice we hear Jesus, in the majesty we see God.

**[6:18]** How can we help believing that in one and the same (Personal) substance God and Jesus exist.

**[6:19]** But I should like to have a few more words with you on this subject.

**[6:20]** Tell me, I pray you, if there appeared to you in your present persecution of the Catholic faith that same vision which then appeared to the Apostle in his ignorance, if when you were not expecting it and were off your guard, that radiance shone round about you, and the glory of that boundless light smote you in your terror and confusion, and you lay prostrate in darkness of body and soul; which the unlimited and indescribable terror of your heart increased,â€”tell me, I intreat you; When the dread of immediate death was pressing on you, and the terror of the glory that threatened you from above, weighed you down, and you  heard as well in your bewilderment of mind those words which your sin so well deserves: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" and to your inquiry who it was the answer was given from heaven: "I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest," what would you say? "I do not know, I do not yet fully believe.

**[6:21]** I want to think over it with myself a little longer, who I think that Thou art, who speakest from heaven, who overwhelmest me with the brightness of Thy Divinity: whose voice I hear and whose splendour I cannot bear.

**[6:22]** I must consider of this matter, whether I ought to believe Thee or not: whether Thou art Christ or God.

**[6:23]** If Thou art God alone whether it is in Christ.

**[6:24]** If Thou art Christ alone, whether it is in God.

**[6:25]** I want this distinction to be carefully observed, and thoroughly considered what we should believe that Thou art, and what we should judge Thee to be.

**[6:26]** For I don't want any of my offices to be wasted.

**[6:27]** As if I were to regard Thee as a man, and yet pay to Thee some Divine honours".

**[6:28]** If then you were lying on the ground, as the Apostle Paul was then lying, and overwhelmed with the brightness of the Divine light, were at your last gasp, perhaps you would say this, and prate with all this silly chattering.

**[6:29]** But what shall we make of the fact that another course commended itself to the Apostle; and when he had fallen down, trembling and half dead, he did not think that he ought any longer to conceal his belief, or to deliberate; it was enough for him that he was taught by inexpressible arguments to know that He whom he had ignorantly fancied to be a man, was God.

**[6:30]** He did not conceal his belief, he made no delay.

**[6:31]** He did not any longer protract his erroneous ideas by deliberating and disbelieving, but as soon as he heard from heaven the name of Jesus his Lord, he replied in a voice, subdued like that of a servant, tremulous like that of one scourged, and full of fervour like that of one converted, "What shall I do, Lord?" And so at once for his ready and earnest faith, it was granted to him that he should never be without His presence whom he had faithfully believed: and that He, to whom he had passed in heart, should Himself pass into his heart: as the Apostle himself says of himself: "Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me?".

**[7:1]** Chapter VII.

**[7:2]** He shows once more by other passages of the Apostle that Christ is God.

**[7:3]** I want you to tell me, you heretic, whether in this passage He who, as the Apostle tells us, speaks in him, is man or God.

**[7:4]** If He is man, how can another's body speak in his heart? If God, then Christ is not a man but God; for since Christ spoke in the Apostle, and only God could speak in him, therefore a Divine Christ spoke in him.

**[7:5]** And so you see that there is nothing to be said here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and God: because complete Divinity was in Christ, and Christ was completely in God.

**[7:6]** No division or severing of the two can here be admitted.

**[7:7]** There is only one simple, pious, and sound confession to be made; viz.

**[7:8]** , to adore, love, and worship Christ as God.

**[7:9]** But do you want to understand more fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God and Christ, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with Christ? Hear what the Apostle says to the Corinthians: "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil".

**[7:10]** But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he says: "We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God".

**[7:11]** You see then that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand then without any doubt that Christ is God; and when you see that the substance of God and Christ is altogether inseparable, admit also that the Person cannot be severed.

**[7:12]** Unless forsooth because the Apostle in one Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and in another before that of God, you invent two judgment seats, and fancy that some will be judged by Christ and others by God.

**[7:13]** But this is foolish and wild, and madder than a madman's utterances.

**[7:14]** Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the God of the universe, acknowledge the judgment seat of God in the judgment seat of Christ.

**[7:15]** Love life, love your salvation, love Him by whom you were created.

**[7:16]** Fear Him by whom you are to be judged.

**[7:17]** For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and laying aside wicked blasphemy and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you think that the judgment seat of God is different from that of Christ, you will come before the judgment seat of Christ, and will find by evidence that there is no gainsaying, that the judgment seat of God is indeed the same as that of Christ, and that in Christ the Son of God, there is all the glory of God the Son, and the power of God the  Father.

**[7:18]** "For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father".

**[7:19]** For whoever denies the Father denies the Son also.

**[7:20]** "Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also".

**[7:21]** And so you should learn that the glory of the Father and the Son is inseparable, and their majesty is inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without the Father, nor the Father without the Son.

**[7:22]** But no man can honour God and the Son of God except in Christ the only-begotten Son of God.

**[7:23]** For it is impossible for a man to have the Spirit of God who is to be honoured except in the Spirit of Christ, as the Apostle says: "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

**[7:24]** But if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His".

**[7:25]** And again: "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.

**[7:26]** Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose again".

**[7:27]** You see then now, even against your will, that there is absolutely no difference between the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, or between the judgment of God and the judgment of Christ.

**[7:28]** Choose then which you willâ€”for one of the two must happenâ€”either acknowledge in faith that Christ is God, or admit that God is in Christ at your condemnation.

**[8:1]** Chapter VIII.

**[8:2]** When confessing the Divinity of Christ we ought not to pass over in silence the confession of the cross.

**[8:3]** But let us see what else follows.

**[8:4]** In writing to the church of Corinth, he whom we spoke of above, the instructor of all the churches viz.

**[8:5]** Paul, speaks thus: "The Jews," says he, "seek signs, and the Greeks ask for wisdom.

**[8:6]** But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, to the Gentiles foolishness: but to them that are saved, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God".

**[8:7]** O most powerful teacher of the faith, who even in this passage, when teaching the Church thought it not enough to speak of Christ as God without adding that He was crucified on purpose that for the sake of the open and solid teaching of the faith he might proclaim Him, whom he called the crucified, to be the wisdom of God.

**[8:8]** He then employed no subtilty or circumlocution, nor did he when he preached the gospel of the Lord blush at the mention of the cross of Christ.

**[8:9]** And though it was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles to hear of God as born, God in bodily form, God suffering, God crucified, yet he did not weaken the force of his pious utterance because of the wickedness of the offence of the Jews: nor did he lessen the vigour of his faith because of the unbelief and the foolishness of others: but openly, persistently, and boldly proclaimed that He, whom a mother had borne, whom men had slain, the spear had pierced, the cross had stretchedâ€”was "the power and wisdom of God, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Gentiles foolishness".

**[8:10]** But still that which was to some a stumbling-block and foolishness, was to others the power and wisdom of God.

**[8:11]** For as the persons differed, so was there a difference of their thoughts: and what a man who was void of sound understanding, and incapable of true good, foolishly denied in unbelief, that a wise faith could feel in its inmost soul to be holy and life giving.

**[9:1]** Chapter IX.

**[9:2]** How the Apostle's preaching was rejected by Jews and Gentiles because it confessed that the crucified Christ was God.

**[9:3]** Tell me then, you heretic, you enemy of all men, but of yourself above allâ€”to whom the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is an offence as with the Jews, and foolishness as with the Gentiles, you who reject the mysteries of true salvation, with the stumbling of the former, and are foolish with the stubbornness of the others, why was the preaching of the Apostle Paul foolishness to the pagans, and a stumbling-block to the Jews? Surely it would never have offended men, if he had taught that Christ was, as you maintain He is, a mere man? For who would think that His birth, passion, cross, and death were incredible or a difficulty? Or what would there have been novel or strange about the preaching of Paul, if he had said that a merely human Christ suffered that which human nature daily endures among men everywhere? But it was surely this that the foolishness of the Gentiles could not receive, and the unbelief of the Jews rejected; viz.

**[9:4]** , that the Apostle declared that Christ whom they, like you, fancied to be a mere man, was God.

**[9:5]** This it certainly was which the thoughts of these wicked men rejected, which the ears of the faithless could not endure; viz.

**[9:6]** , that the  birth of God should be proclaimed in the man Jesus Christ, that the passion of God should be asserted, and the cross of God proclaimed.

**[9:7]** This it was which was a difficulty: this was what was incredible; for that was incredible to the hearing of men, which had never been heard of as happening to the Divine nature.

**[9:8]** And so you are quite secure, with such an announcement and teaching as yours, that your preaching will never be either foolishness to the Gentiles or a stumbling-block to the Jews.

**[9:9]** You will never be crucified with Peter by Jews and Gentiles, nor stoned with James, nor beheaded with Paul.

**[9:10]** For there is nothing in your preaching to offend them.

**[9:11]** You maintain that a mere man was born, a mere man suffered.

**[9:12]** You need not be afraid of their troubling you with persecution, for you are helping them by your preaching.

**[10:1]** Chapter X.

**[10:2]** How the apostle maintains that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.

**[10:3]** But let us see something more on the subject.

**[10:4]** Christ then, according to the Apostle, is the power of God and the wisdom of God.

**[10:5]** What have you to say to this? How can you get out of it? There is no place for you to escape and fly to.

**[10:6]** Christ is the wisdom of God and the power of God.

**[10:7]** He, I say, whom the Jews attacked, the Gentiles mocked, whom you yourself together with them are persecuting,â€”He, I say, who is foolishness to the heathen, and a stumbling-block to the Jews, and both to you, He, I say, is the power of God and the wisdom of God.

**[10:8]** What is there that you can do? Shut your ears, forsooth, so as not to hear? This the Jews did also when the Apostle was preaching.

**[10:9]** Do what you will, Christ is in heaven, and in God, and with Him, and in Him in the heavens above in whom also He was here below: you can no longer persecute Him with the Jews.

**[10:10]** But you do the one thing that you can.

**[10:11]** You persecute Him in the faith, you persecute Him in the church, you persecute Him with the arms of a wicked belief, you persecute Him with the sword of false doctrine.

**[10:12]** Perhaps you do rather more than the Jews of old did.

**[10:13]** You now persecute Christ, after ever those who did persecute Him, have believed.

**[10:14]** But perhaps you think that the sin is less because you can no longer lay hands on Him.

**[10:15]** No less grievous, I tell you, no less grievous to Him is that persecution, in which sinful men persecute Him in the persons of His followers.

**[10:16]** But the mention of the Lord's cross offends you.

**[10:17]** It always offended the Jews as well.

**[10:18]** You shudder at hearing that God suffered: the Gentiles in their error mocked at this also.

**[10:19]** I ask you then, in what point do you differ from them, since you both agree in this frowardness? But for my part I not only do not water down this preaching of the holy cross, this preaching of the Lord's passion, but as far as my wishes and powers go I emphasise it.

**[10:20]** For I will declare that He who was crucified is not only the power and wisdom of God, than which there is nothing greater, but actually Lord of absolute Divinity and glory.

**[10:21]** And this the rather, because this assertion of mine is the doctrine of God, as the Apostle says: "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect: but the wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world who are brought to nought: but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory: which none of the princes of this world knew: for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

**[10:22]** But as it is written: that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that love Him".

**[10:23]** You see what great matters the Apostle's discourse comprises in how small a compass.

**[10:24]** He says that he speaks wisdom, but a wisdom which only those that are perfect can know, and which the prudent of this world cannot know.

**[10:25]** For he says that this is the wisdom of God, which is hidden in a Divine mystery, and predestined before all worlds for the glory of the saints: and that therefore it is only known to those who savour of God; while the princes of this world are utterly ignorant of it.

**[10:26]** But he adds the reason, to establish both points that he had mentioned, saying: "For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

**[10:27]** But it is written, that eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that love Him".

**[10:28]** You see then how the wisdom of God, hidden in a mystery, and predestined before all worlds, was unknown to those who crucified the Lord of glory, and known by those who received it.

**[10:29]** And well does he say that the wisdom of God was hidden in a mystery, for never yet could the eye of any man see, or the ear hear, or the heart imagine this; viz.

**[10:30]** , that the Lord of glory should be born of a virgin and come in the flesh, and suffer all kinds of punishment, and shameful passion.

**[10:31]** But with regard to these gifts of God, as there is no one whoâ€”since  they were hidden in a mysteryâ€”could ever of himself understand them, so blessed is he who has grasped them when they are revealed.

**[10:32]** Thus all who have failed to grasp them must be reckoned among the princes of this world, and those who have grasped them among God's wise ones.

**[10:33]** He then does not grasp it who denies God born in the flesh; therefore you also do not grasp it, as you deny this.

**[10:34]** But do what you will, deny as impiously as you like, we the rather believe the Apostle.

**[10:35]** But why should I say the Apostle? the rather do we believe God.

**[10:36]** For through the Apostle we believe Him, whom we know to have spoken by the Apostle.

**[10:37]** The Divine word says that the Lord of glory was crucified by the princes of the world.

**[10:38]** You deny it.

**[10:39]** They also who crucified Him denied that it was God whom they were crucifying.

**[10:40]** They then who confess Him have their portion with the Apostle who confessed Him.

**[10:41]** You are sure to have your lot with His persecutors.

**[10:42]** What is there then that can be replied to this? The Apostle says that the Lord of glory was crucified.

**[10:43]** Alter this if you can.

**[10:44]** Separate now, if you please, Jesus from God.

**[10:45]** At least you cannot deny that Christ was crucified by the Jews.

**[10:46]** But it was the Lord of glory who was crucified.

**[10:47]** Therefore you must either deny that Christ was nailed to the cross, or you must admit that God was nailed to it.

**[11:1]** Chapter XI.

**[11:2]** He supports the same doctrine by proofs from the gospel.

**[11:3]** But perhaps it is a difficulty to you that all this time I am chiefly using the witness of the Apostle Paul alone.

**[11:4]** He is good enough for me, whom God chose, nor do I blush to call as the witness to my faith, the man whom God willed to be the teacher of the whole world.

**[11:5]** But to yield to your wishes, as perhaps you fancy that I have no other proofs to use, hear the perfect mystery of man's salvation and eternal bliss, which Martha proclaims in the gospel.

**[11:6]** For what does she say? "Of a truth, Lord, I have believed that Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, who art come into this world".

**[11:7]** Learn the true faith from a woman.

**[11:8]** Learn the confession of eternal hope.

**[11:9]** Yet you have a splendid consolation: you need not blush to be taught the mystery of salvation by her, whose testimony God did not refuse to accept.

**[12:1]** Chapter XII.

**[12:2]** He proves from the renowned confession of the blessed Peter that Christ is God.

**[12:3]** But if you prefer the authority of a greater person (although you ought not to slight the authority of any one of either sex, on whom the confession of the mystery confers weightâ€”for whatever may be a person's condition, or however humble his position, yet the value of his faith is not thereby diminished) let us interrogate no beginner or untaught schoolboy, nor a woman whose faith might perhaps appear to be but rudimentary; but that greatest of disciples among disciples, and of teachers among teachers, who presided and ruled over the Roman Church, and held the chief place in the priesthood as he did in the faith.

**[12:4]** Tell us then, tell us, we pray, O Peter, thou chief of Apostles, tell us how the Churches ought to believe in God.

**[12:5]** For it is right that you should teach us, as you were taught by the Lord, and that you should open to us the gate, of which you received the key.

**[12:6]** Shut out all those who try to overthrow the heavenly house: and those who are endeavouring to enter by secret holes and unlawful approaches: as it is clear that none can enter the gate of the kingdom save one to whom the key bestowed on the Churches is revealed by you.

**[12:7]** Tell us then how we ought to believe in Jesus Christ and to confess our common Lord.

**[12:8]** You will surely reply without hesitation: "Why do you consult me as to the way in which the Lord should be confessed, when you have before you my own confession of Him? Read the gospel, and you will not want me myself, when you have got my confession.

**[12:9]** Nay, you have got me myself when you have my confession; for though I have no weight apart from my confession, yet the actual confession adds weight to my person".

**[12:10]** Tell us then, O Evangelist, tell us the confession: tell us the faith of the chief Apostle: did he confess that Jesus was only a man, or God? did he say that there was nothing but flesh in Him, or did he proclaim Him the Son of God? When then the Lord Jesus Christ asked whom the disciples believed and confessed Him to be, Peter, the first of the Apostles, repliedâ€”one in the name of allâ€”for the answer of one was to the same effect as the faith of them all.

**[12:11]** But it was fitting that he should first give the answer, that the order of the answer might correspond to the degree of honour: and that he might outstrip them in confession, as he outstripped them in age.

**[12:12]** What then does he  say? "Thou art," he says, "the Christ the Son of the living God".

**[12:13]** I am obliged, you heretic, to make use of a plain and simple question to confute you.

**[12:14]** Tell me, I pray, who was He, to whom Peter gave that answer? You cannot deny that it was the Christ.

**[12:15]** I ask then, what do you call Christ? man or God? Man certainly without any doubt: for hence springs the whole of your heresy, because you deny that Christ is the Son of God.

**[12:16]** And so too you say that Mary is Christotocos, but not Theotocos, because she was the mother of Christ, not of God.

**[12:17]** Therefore you maintain, that Christ is only a man, and not God, and so that He is the Son of man not of God.

**[12:18]** What then does Peter reply to this? "Thou art," he says, "the Christ, the Son of the living God".

**[12:19]** That Christ whom you declare to be only the Son of man, he testifies to be the Son of God.

**[12:20]** Whom would you like us to believe? you or Peter? I imagine that you are not so shameless as to venture to prefer your own opinion to that of the first of the Apostles.

**[12:21]** And yet what is there that you would not venture on? or how can you help scorning the Apostle, if you can deny God? "Thou art then," he says, "the Christ, the Son of the living God".

**[12:22]** Is there anything puzzling or obscure in this? It is nothing but a plain and open confession: he proclaims Christ to be the Son of God.

**[12:23]** Perhaps you will deny that the words were spoken: but the Evangelist testifies that they were.

**[12:24]** Or do you say that the Apostle told a lie? But it is an awful lie to accuse an Apostle of lying.

**[12:25]** Or perhaps you will maintain that the words were spoken of some other Christ? But this is a novel kind of monstrous fabrication.

**[12:26]** What then is left for you? One thing indeed; viz.

**[12:27]** , that since what is written is read, and what is read is true, you should finally be driven by force and compulsion (as you cannot assert its falsehood) to desist from impugning its truth.

**[13:1]** Chapter XIII.

**[13:2]** The confession of the blessed Peter receives a testimony to its truth from Christ Himself.

**[13:3]** But still, as I have made use of the testimony of the chief Apostle, in which he openly confessed the Lord Jesus Christ as God, let us see how He whom he confessed approved of his confession; for of far more value than the Apostle's words is the fact that God Himself commended his utterance.

**[13:4]** When then the Apostle said: "Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God," what was the answer of our Lord and Saviour? "Blessed art thou," said He, "Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but the Spirit of My Father which is in heaven".

**[13:5]** If you do not like to use the testimony of the Apostle use that of God.

**[13:6]** For by commending what was said God added His own authority to the Apostle's utterance, so that although the utterance came from the lips of the Apostle, yet God who approved of it made it His own.

**[13:7]** "Blessed art thou," said He, "Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but the Spirit of My Father which is in heaven".

**[13:8]** Thus in the words of the Apostle you have the testimony of the Holy Spirit and of the Son who was present and of God the Father.

**[13:9]** What more can you want, or what comes up to this? The Son commended: the Father was present: the Holy Ghost revealed.

**[13:10]** The utterance of the Apostle thus gives the testimony of the entire Godhead: for this utterance must necessarily have the authority of Him from whose prompting it proceeds.

**[13:11]** "Blessed then art thou," said He, "Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but the Spirit of My Father which is in heaven".

**[13:12]** If then flesh and blood did not reveal this to Peter or inspire him, you must at last see who inspires you.

**[13:13]** If the Spirit of God taught him who confessed that Christ was God, you see how you are taught by the spirit of the devil if you can deny it.

**[14:1]** Chapter XIV.

**[14:2]** How the confession of the blessed Peter is the faith of the whole Church.

**[14:3]** But what are the other words which follow that saying of the Lord's, with which He commends Peter? "And I," said He, "say unto thee, that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build My Church".

**[14:4]** Do you see how the saying of Peter is the faith of the Church? He then must of course be outside the Church, who does not hold the faith of the Church.

**[14:5]** "And to thee," saith the Lord, "I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven".

**[14:6]** This faith deserved heaven: this faith received the keys of the heavenly kingdom.

**[14:7]** See what awaits you.

**[14:8]** You cannot enter the gate to which this key belongs, if you have denied the faith of this key.

**[14:9]** "And the gate," He adds, "of hell shall not prevail against thee".

**[14:10]** The gates of hell are the belief or rather the misbelief of heretics.

**[14:11]** For widely as hell is separated from heaven,  so widely is he who denies from him who confessed that Christ is God.

**[14:12]** "Whatsoever," He proceeds, "thou shalt bind on earth, shalt be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shalt be loosed also in heaven".

**[14:13]** The perfect faith of the Apostle somehow is given the power of Deity, that what it should bind or loose on earth, might be bound or loosed in heaven.

**[14:14]** For you then, who come against the Apostle's faith, as you see that already you are bound on earth, it only remains that you should know that you are bound also in heaven.

**[14:15]** But it would take too long to go into details which are so numerous as to make a long and wearisome story, even if they are related with brevity and conciseness.

**[15:1]** Chapter XV.

**[15:2]** St.

**[15:3]** Thomas also confessed the same faith as Peter after the Lord's resurrection.

**[15:4]** But I want still to add one more testimony from an Apostle for you: that you may see how what followed after the passion corresponded with what went before it.

**[15:5]** When then the Lord appeared in the midst of His disciples when the doors were shut, and wished to make clear to the Apostles the reality of His body, when the Apostle Thomas felt His flesh and handled His side and examined His woundsâ€”what was it that he declared, when he was convinced of the reality of the body shown to him? "My Lord," he said, "and my God".

**[15:6]** Did he say what you say, that it was a man and not God? Christ and not Divinity? He surely touched the body of his Lord and answered that He was God.

**[15:7]** Did he make any separation between man and God? or did he call that flesh Theotocos, to use your expression, i-e:, that which received Divinity? or did he, after the fashion of your blasphemy, declare that He whom he touched was to be honoured not for His own sake, but for the sake of Him whom He had received into Himself? But perhaps God's Apostle knew nothing of that subtle separation of yours, and had no experience of the fine distinctions of your judgment, as he was a rude countryman, ignorant of the dialectic art, and of the method of philosophic disputation; for whom the Lord's teaching was amply sufficient, and as he was one who knew nothing whatever except what he learnt from the instruction of the Lord! And so his words contain heavenly doctrine; his faith is a Divine lesson.

**[15:8]** He had never learnt to separate, as you do, the Lord from His body: and had no idea how to rend God asunder from Himself.

**[15:9]** He was holy, straightforward, upright: filled with practical innocence, unalloyed faith, and pure knowledge: having a simple understanding joined with prudence, a wisdom entirely free from all evil, together with perfect simplicity: ignorant of any corruption, and free from all heretical perversity, and as one who had experienced in himself the force of the Divine lesson, he held fast everything which he had learnt.

**[15:10]** And so heâ€”countryman and ignorant fellow as you fancy himâ€”shuts you up with a brief answer, and destroys your position with a few words of his.

**[15:11]** What then did the Apostle Thomas touch when he drew near to handle his God? Certainly it was Christ without any doubt.

**[15:12]** But what did he exclaim? "My Lord," he said, "and my God".

**[15:13]** Now, if you can, separate Christ from God, and change this saying, if you are able to.

**[15:14]** Make use of all dialectic artâ€”all the prudence of this world, and that foolish wisdom which consists in wordy subtlety.

**[15:15]** Turn yourself about in every direction, and draw in your horns.

**[15:16]** Do whatever you can with ingenuity and art.

**[15:17]** Say what you like, and do what you like; you cannot possibly get out of this without confessing that what the Apostle touched was God.

**[15:18]** And indeed, if the thing can possibly be done, perhaps you will want to alter the statement of the gospel story, so that we may not read that the Apostle Thomas touched the body of the Lord, or that he called Christ Lord and God.

**[15:19]** But it is absolutely impossible to alter what is written in the gospel of God.

**[15:20]** For "heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words" of God "shall not pass away".

**[15:21]** For lo, even now he who then bore his witness, the Apostle Thomas, proclaims to you: "Jesus whom I touched is God.

**[15:22]** It is God whose limbs I handled.

**[15:23]** I did not feel what was incorporeal, not handle what was intangible: I touched not a Spirit with my hand, so that it might be believed that I said of it alone 'It is God.

**[15:24]** ' For 'a spirit,' as my Lord Himself said, 'hath not flesh and bones.

**[15:25]** ' I touched the body of my Lord.

**[15:26]** I handled flesh and bones.

**[15:27]** I put my fingers into the prints of the wounds: and I declared of Christ my Lord, whom I had handled: 'My Lord and my God.

**[15:28]** ' For I know not how to make a separation between Christ and God, and I cannot insert blasphemous distinctions between Jesus and God, or rend my Lord asunder from Himself.

**[15:29]** Away from me, whoever is of a different opinion, and whoever says anything different.

**[15:30]** I know not that  Christ is other than God.

**[15:31]** This faith I held together with my fellow apostles: this I delivered to the Churches: this I preached to the Gentiles: this I proclaim to thee also, Christ is God, Christ is God.

**[15:32]** A sound mind imagines nothing else: a sound faith says nothing else.

**[15:33]** The Deity cannot be parted from Itself.

**[15:34]** And since whatever is Christ is God, there can be found in God none other but God".

**[16:1]** Chapter XVI.

**[16:2]** He brings forward the witness of God the Father to the Divinity of the Son.

**[16:3]** What do you say now, you heretic? Are these evidences of the faith, aye and of all your unbelief, enough for you: or would you like some more to be added to them? but what can be added after Prophets and Apostles? unless perhapsâ€”as the Jews once demandedâ€”you too might ask for a sign to be given you from heaven? But if you ask this, we must give you the same answer which was formerly given to them: "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign.

**[16:4]** And no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah".

**[16:5]** And indeed this sign would be enough for you as for the Jews who crucified Him, that you might be taught to believe in the Lord God by this alone, through which even those who had persecuted Him, came to believe.

**[16:6]** But as we have mentioned a sign from heaven, I will show you a sign from heaven: and one of such a character that even the devils have never gainsaid it: while, constrained by the demands of truth, though they saw Jesus in bodily form, they yet cried out that He was God, as indeed He was.

**[16:7]** What then does the Evangelist say of the Lord Jesus Christ? "When He was baptized," he says, "straightway He went up out of the water.

**[16:8]** And lo, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and coming upon Him.

**[16:9]** And behold, a voice from heaven, saying: This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".

**[16:10]** What do you say to this, you heretic? Do you dislike the words spoken, or the Person of the Speaker? The meaning of the utterance at any rate needs no explanation: nor does the worth of the Speaker need the commendation of words.

**[16:11]** It is God the Father who spoke.

**[16:12]** What He said is clear enough.

**[16:13]** Surely you cannot make so shameless and blasphemous an assertion as to say that God the Father is not to be believed concerning the only begotten Son of God? "This," He then says, "is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased".

**[16:14]** But perhaps you will try to maintain that this is madness, and that this was said of the Word and not of Christ.

**[16:15]** Tell me then who was it who was baptized? The Word or Christ? Flesh or Spirit? You cannot possibly deny that it was Christ.

**[16:16]** That man then, born of man and of God, conceived by the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Virgin, and by the overshadowing of the Power of the Most High, and thus the Son of man and of God, He it was, as you cannot deny, who was baptized.

**[16:17]** If then it was He who was baptized, it was He also who was named, for certainly the Person who was baptized was the one named.

**[16:18]** "This," said He, "is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".

**[16:19]** Could anything be said with greater significance or clearness? Christ was baptized.

**[16:20]** Christ went up out of the water.

**[16:21]** When Christ was baptized the heavens were opened.

**[16:22]** For Christ's sake the dove descended upon Christ, the Holy Spirit was present in a bodily form.

**[16:23]** The Father addressed Christ.

**[16:24]** If you venture to deny that this was spoken of Christ, the only thing is for you to maintain that Christ was not baptized, that the Spirit did not descend, and that the Father did not speak.

**[16:25]** But the truth itself is urgent and weighs you down so that even if you will not confess it, yet you cannot deny it.

**[16:26]** For what says the Evangelist? "When He was baptized, straightway He went up out of the water".

**[16:27]** Who was baptized? Most certainly Christ.

**[16:28]** "And behold," he says, "the heavens were opened to Him".

**[16:29]** To where, forsooth, save to Him who was baptized? Most certainly to Christ.

**[16:30]** "And He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him".

**[16:31]** Who saw? Christ indeed.

**[16:32]** Upon whom did It descend? Most certainly upon Christ.

**[16:33]** "And a voice came from heaven.

**[16:34]** saying"â€”of whom? Of Christ indeed: for what follows? "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".

**[16:35]** In order that it might be made clear on whose account all this happened, there followed the voice, saying: "This is My beloved Son," as if to say: This is He on whose account all this took place.

**[16:36]** For this is My Son: on His account the heavens were opened: on His account My Spirit came: on His account My voice was heard.

**[16:37]** For this is My Son.

**[16:38]** In saying then "This is My Son" whom did He so designate? Certainly Him whom the dove touched.

**[16:39]** And whom did the dove touch? Christ indeed.

**[16:40]** Therefore Christ is the Son of God.

**[16:41]** My promise is fulfilled, I fancy.

**[16:42]** Do you see  then now, O heretic, a sign given you from heaven; and not one only, but many and special ones? For there is one in the opening of heaven, another in the descent of the Spirit, a third in the voice of the Father.

**[16:43]** All of which most clearly show that Christ is God, for the laying open of the heavens indicates that He is God, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Him supports His Divinity, and the address of the Father confirms it.

**[16:44]** For heaven would not have been opened except in honour of its Lord: nor would the Holy Ghost have descended in a bodily form except upon the Son of God: nor would the Father have declared Him to be the Son, had he not been truly such; especially with such tokens of a Divine birth, as not merely to confirm the truth of the right faith, but also to exclude the wickedness of guilty and erroneous belief.

**[16:45]** For when the Father had expressly and pointedly said with the inexpressible majesty of a Divine utterance, "This is My Son," He added also what followsâ€”I mean, "My beloved, in whom I am well pleased".

**[16:46]** As He had already declared Him by the prophet to be God the Mighty and God the Great, so when He says here, "My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased," He adds further to the name of His own Son the title also of His beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased: that the addition of the titles might denote the special properties of the Divine nature; and that that might specially redound to the glory of the Son of God, which had never happened to any man.

**[16:47]** And so just as in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ these special and unique things happened; viz.

**[16:48]** , that the heavens were opened, that in the sight of all God the Father touched Him in a sort of way, through the coming and presence of the dove, and pointed almost with His finger to Him saying, "This is My Son;" so this too is special and unique in His case; viz.

**[16:49]** , that He is specially beloved, and is specially named as well-pleasing to the Father, in order that these special accompaniments might mark the special import of His nature, and that the special character of His names might support the special position of the only begotten Son, which the honour of the signs previously given had already confirmed.

**[16:50]** But here comes the end of this book.

**[16:51]** For this saying of God the Father can neither be added to, nor equalled by any words of men.

**[16:52]** For us God the Father Himself is a sufficiently satisfactory witness concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, when He says "This is My Son".

**[16:53]** If you think that it is possible for these utterances of God the Father to be gainsaid, then you are forced to contradict Him, who by the clearest possible announcement caused Him to be acknowledged as His Son by the whole world.
