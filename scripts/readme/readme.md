# Scrollmapper :: Deuterocanonical / Extrabiblical Project

Welcome to the other part of the Scrollmapper project.

Our objective is to compile a comprehensive collection of early extra-biblical writings. These texts range in preservation quality, with some being impeccably maintained and others existing only in fragments. We are committed to continuously updating and refining these texts to rectify any errors introduced during their transmission.

## Purpose of this project.

There have been many scattered biblical texts throughout the world. We want to find as many as possible and record them here for digital portability.

A good example is the recently discovered Book of [Gad the Seer, a recently rediscovered lost biblical book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gad_the_Seer), released in 2015. It has also been [included in this library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases_deuterocanonical/refs/heads/master/sources/en/gad-the-seer/gad-the-seer.md).

## Deuterocanonical or Extrabiblical...

Technically, these are "Extrabiblical" books in the sense that they are not in the common canons of scripture. Other canons include other books. For example, [the Ge'ez (Ethiopic) bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch) contains the much-prized [Book of Enoch](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases_deuterocanonical/blob/master/sources/en/1-enoch/1-enoch.md). Catholic bibles contain the Apocrypha. Other older bibles may contain other lost books.

The list of commonly accepted biblical books has shrunk over the centuries. Many people today are rejoicing at the rediscovery of these books and are seeing them as perfectly valid scripture.

This collection puts aside the labels of Apocryphal, Pseudepigraphical, etc., and simply accepts the concept of "extra-biblical," or rather, books that did not get included into the common canon of the scriptures although they were at one time relevant to Christians and Jews. 

## NOTICE:

Please note that this project is currently undergoing reconstruction. We invite you to check back periodically for updates.
